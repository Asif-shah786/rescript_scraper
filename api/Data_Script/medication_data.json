    "metabolism": "Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in systemic circulation. At steady-state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.8",
    "route_of_elimination": "Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces.8,4",

The oral formulations are indicated for: \u2022 Schizophrenia (14.1) \u2022 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder (14.4) \u2022 Treatment of Tourette\u2019s disorder (14.5)",
    "dosage_and_administration": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Dose Recommended Dose Maximum Dose Schizophrenia \u2013 adults (2.1) 10 to 15 mg/day 10 to 15 mg/day 30 mg/day Schizophrenia \u2013 adolescents (2.1) 2 mg/day 10 mg/day 30 mg/day Irritability associated with autistic disorder \u2013 pediatric patients (2.4) 2 mg/day 5 to 10 mg/day 15 mg/day Tourette\u2019s disorder \u2013 (2.5) Patients <50 kg 2 mg/day 5 mg/day 10 mg/day Patients \u226550 kg 2 mg/day 10 mg/day 20 mg/day \u2022Oral formulations: Administer once daily without regard to meals (2) \u2022Known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers: Half of the usual dose (2.7) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults The recommended starting and target dose for aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Aripiprazole has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day, when administered as the tablet formulation; however, doses higher than 10 or 15 mg/day were not more effective than 10 or 15 mg/day. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steady-state [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Maintenance Treatment: Maintenance of efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either aripiprazole 15 mg/day or placebo, and observed for relapse [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. Adolescents The recommended target dose of aripiprazole is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mg/day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. Aripiprazole can be administered without regard to meals [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from other antipsychotics to aripiprazole or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. 2.4 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder Pediatric Patients (6 to 17 years) The recommended dosage range for the treatment of pediatric patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder is 5 to 15 mg/day. Dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day. The dose should be increased to 5 mg/day, with subsequent increases to 10 or 15 mg/day if needed. Dose adjustments of up to 5 mg/day should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than one week [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. 2.5 Tourette\u2019s Disorder Pediatric Patients (6 to 18 years) The recommended dosage range for Tourette\u2019s Disorder is 5 to 20 mg/day. For patients weighing less than 50 kg, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day with a target dose of 5 mg/day after 2 days. The dose can be increased to 10 mg/day in patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics. Dosage adjustments should occur gradually at intervals of no less than one week. For patients weighing 50 kg or more, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day for 2 days, and then increased to 5 mg/day for 5 days, with a target dose of 10 mg/day on Day 8. The dose can be increased up to 20 mg/day for patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics. Dosage adjustments should occur gradually in increments of 5 mg/day at intervals of no less than one week [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. 2.7 Dosage Adjustments for Cytochrome P450 Considerations Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients who are known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers (see Table 2). When the coadministered drug is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dosage should then be adjusted to its original level. When the coadministered CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn, aripiprazole dosage should be reduced to the original level over 1 to 2 weeks. Patients who may be receiving a combination of strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (e.g., a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor), the dosing may be reduced to one-quarter (25%) of the usual dose initially and then adjusted to achieve a favorable clinical response. Table 2: Dose Adjustments for Aripiprazole in Patients who are known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers and Patients Taking Concomitant CYP2D6 Inhibitors, 3A4 Inhibitors, and/or CYP3A4 Inducers Factors Dosage Adjustments for Aripiprazole Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Administer half of usual dose Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) Administer a quarter of usual dose Strong CYP2D6 (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) Administer half of usual dose Strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of usual dose Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin) Double usual dose over 1 to 2 weeks 2.8 Dosing of Oral Solution The oral solution can be substituted for tablets on a mg-per-mg basis up to the 25 mg dose level. Patients receiving 30 mg tablets should receive 25 mg of the solution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",
    "mechanism_of_action": "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia is unclear. However, the efficacy of aripiprazole in the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D 2 and 5-HT 1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT 2A receptors.",

Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. Safety Experience in Elderly Patients with Psychosis Associated with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease In three, 10 week, placebo-controlled studies of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n=938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56 to 99 years), the adverse reactions that were reported at an incidence of \u22653% and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo were lethargy [placebo 2%, aripiprazole 5%], somnolence (including sedation) [placebo 3%, aripiprazole 8%], and incontinence (primarily, urinary incontinence) [placebo 1%, aripiprazole 5%], excessive salivation [placebo 0%, aripiprazole 4%], and lightheadedness [placebo 1%, aripiprazole 4%]. The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with dementia have not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with aripiprazole, assess for the emergence of difficulty swallowing or excessive somnolence, which could predispose to accidental injury or aspiration [see Boxed Warning]. 5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke In placebo-controlled clinical studies (two flexible dose and one fixed dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in aripiprazole-treated patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.3 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24 years) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 years; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 years and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 5. Table 5: Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case \u226565 6 fewer case No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for aripiprazole should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that aripiprazole is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, aripiprazole should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on aripiprazole, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with aripiprazole despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.6 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Although fewer patients have been treated with aripiprazole, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies which did not include aripiprazole suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. Because aripiprazole was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if aripiprazole is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Adults In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adults, primarily with schizophrenia or another indication, the mean change in fasting glucose in aripiprazole-treated patients (+4.4 mg/dL; median exposure 25 days; N=1,057) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (+2.5 mg/dL; median exposure 22 days; N=799). Table 6 shows the proportion of aripiprazole-treated patients with normal and borderline fasting glucose at baseline (median exposure 25 days) that had treatment-emergent high fasting glucose measurements compared to placebo-treated patients (median exposure 22 days).

Pediatric Patients and Adolescents In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with another indication (10 to 17 years), the mean change in fasting glucose in aripiprazole-treated patients (+4.8 mg/dL; with a median exposure of 43 days; N=259) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (+1.7 mg/dL; with a median exposure of 42 days; N=123). In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric and adolescent patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder (6 to 17 years) with median exposure of 56 days, the mean change in fasting glucose in aripiprazole -treated patients (\u20130.2 mg/dL; N=83) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (\u20130.6 mg/dL; N=33). In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric and adolescent patients with Tourette\u2019s disorder (6 to 18 years) with median exposure of 57 days, the mean change in fasting glucose in aripiprazole-treated patients (0.79 mg/dL; N=90) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (\u20131.66 mg/dL; N=58). Table 8 shows the proportion of patients with changes in fasting glucose levels from the pooled adolescent schizophrenia and another indication (median exposure of 42 to 43 days), from two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder (median exposure of 56 days), and from the two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 18 year) with Tourette\u2019s Disorder (median exposure 57 days).

Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There were no significant differences between aripiprazole- and placebo-treated patients in the proportion with changes from normal to clinically significant levels for fasting/nonfasting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting LDLs, and fasting/nonfasting HDLs.

Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. Adults In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, primarily from pooled schizophrenia and another indication, with a median exposure of 21 to 25 days, the mean change in body weight in aripiprazole-treated patients was +0.3 kg (N=1673) compared to \u20130.1 kg (N=1100) in placebo-controlled patients. At 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in body weight in aripiprazole-treated patients was \u20131.5 kg (n=73) compared to \u20130.2 kg (n=46) in placebo-treated patients. Table 14 shows the percentage of adult patients with weight gain \u22657% of body weight by indication.

Pediatric Patients and Adolescents In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with another indication(10 to 17 years) with median exposure of 42 to 43 days, the mean change in body weight in aripiprazole-treated patients was +1.6 kg (N=381) compared to +0.3 kg (N=187) in placebo-treated patients. At 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in body weight in aripiprazole-treated patients was +5.8 kg (n=62) compared to +1.4 kg (n=13) in placebo-treated patients. In two short-term, placebo-controlled trials in patients (6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder with median exposure of 56 days, the mean change in body weight in aripiprazole -treated patients was +1.6 kg (n=209) compared to +0.4 kg (n=98) in placebo-treated patients. In two short-term, placebo-controlled trials in patients (6 to 18 years) with Tourette\u2019s Disorder with median exposure of 57 days, the mean change in body weight in aripiprazole -treated patients was +1.5 kg (n=105) compared to +0.4 kg (n=66) in placebo-treated patients. Table 15 shows the percentage of pediatric and adolescent patients with weight gain \u22657% of body weight by indication. Table 15: Percentage of Patients from Placebo-Controlled Monotherapy Trials in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients with Weight Gain \u22657% of Body Weight Indication Treatment Arm N Patients n (%) Weight gain \u22657% of body weight Pooled Schizophrenia and Another Indication * Aripiprazole 381 20 (5.2) Placebo 187 3 (1.6) Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder \u2020 Aripiprazole 209 55 (26.3) Placebo 98 7 (7.1) Tourette\u2019s Disorder \u2021 Aripiprazole 105 21 (20) Placebo 66 5 (7.6) * 4 to 6 weeks duration \u2020 8 weeks duration. \u2021 8 to 10 weeks duration. In an open-label trial that enrolled patients from the two placebo-controlled trials of adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with another indication(10 to 17 years), 73.2% of patients (238/325) completed 26 weeks of therapy with aripiprazole. After 26 weeks, 32.8% of patients gained \u22657% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients and adolescents by comparisons to age- and gender-matched population standards. A z-score change <0.5 SD is considered not clinically significant. After 26 weeks, the mean change in z-score was 0.09 SD. In an open-label trial that enrolled patients from two short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients (6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder, as well as de novo patients, 60.3% (199/330) completed one year of therapy with aripiprazole. The mean change in weight z-score was 0.26 SDs for patients receiving >9 months of treatment. When treating pediatric patients for any indication, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth. 5.7 Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying disorder. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced, or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges. 5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension Aripiprazole may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its \u03b1 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from short-term, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients on oral aripiprazole (n=2,467) included (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence) orthostatic hypotension (1%, 0.3%), postural dizziness (0.5%, 0.3%), and syncope (0.5%, 0.4%); of pediatric patients 6 to 18 years of age (n=732) on oral aripiprazole included orthostatic hypotension (0.5%, 0%), postural dizziness (0.4%, 0%), and syncope (0.2%, 0%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure \u226520 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate \u226525 bpm when comparing standing to supine values) for aripiprazole was not meaningfully different from placebo (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult oral aripiprazole-treated patients (4%, 2%), in pediatric oral aripiprazole-treated patients aged 6 to 18 years (0.4%, 1%). Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 5.9 Falls Antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of aripiprazole at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue aripiprazole in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mm 3 ) and follow their WBC counts until recovery. 5.11 Seizures/Convulsions In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2,467) of adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years). As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Aripiprazole, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. For example, in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, somnolence (including sedation) was reported as follows (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult patients (n=2,467) treated with oral aripiprazole (11%, 6%), in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years (n=611; 24%, 6%). Somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.3% (8/2,467) of adult patients and 3% (20/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) on oral aripiprazole in short-term, placebo-controlled trials. Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of these events compared to placebo, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with aripiprazole does not affect them adversely. 5.13 Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing aripiprazole for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.14 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for aripiprazole should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.15 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including aripiprazole. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .",

    "abuse": "9.2 Abuse Aripiprazole has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of aripiprazole tablets misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).",
    "dependence": "9.3 Dependence In physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.",
    "information_for_patients": "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide). Discuss the following issues with patients prescribed Aripiprazole: Clinical Worsening of Depression and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient\u2019s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with aripiprazole and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide including information about \u201cAntidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions\u201d is available for aripiprazole. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. It should be noted that aripiprazole tablets are not approved as a single agent for treatment of depression and has not been evaluated in pediatric major depressive disorder. Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors Advise patients and their caregivers of the possibility that they may experience compulsive urges to shop, intense urges to gamble, compulsive sexual urges, binge eating and/or other compulsive urges and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. In some cases, but not all, the urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or stopped [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Because aripiprazole may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] . Concomitant Medication Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Heat Exposure and Dehydration Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] . Pregnancy Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole. Advise patients that aripiprazole may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms (agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder) in a neonate. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to aripiprazole during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

The most common adverse reactions in the pediatric clinical trials (\u226510%) were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, other indications, Dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and alcoholism, andwho had approximately 7,619 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole and 749 patients with exposure to aripiprazole injection. A total of 3,390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 1,933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least one year of exposure. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 1,686 pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, autistic disorder, or Tourette\u2019s disorder or another indication and who had approximately 1,342 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 959 pediatric patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 556 pediatric patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least one year of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole tablets included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure. Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% and at least twice that for placebo) were (6.1): \u2022 Adult patients with schizophrenia: akathisia \u2022 Pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia: extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor \u2022 Pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with autistic disorder: sedation, fatigue, vomiting, somnolence, tremor, pyrexia, drooling, decreased appetite, salivary hypersecretion, extrapyramidal disorder, and lethargy \u2022 Pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) with Tourette\u2019s disorder: sedation, somnolence, nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, increased appetite To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Adult Patients with Schizophrenia The following findings are based on a pool of five placebo-controlled trials (four 4 week and one 6 week) in which oral aripiprazole was administered in doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg/day. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The only commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (aripiprazole 8%; placebo 4%). Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adults Table 17 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in schizophrenia and up to 3 weeks in another indication), including only those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with aripiprazole (doses \u22652 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with aripiprazole was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo in the combined dataset.

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential adverse reaction incidence on the basis of age, gender, or race. Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years) with Schizophrenia The following findings are based on one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial in which oral aripiprazole was administered in doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg/day. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazole-treated and placebo-treated pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) was 5% and 2%, respectively. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of aripiprazole in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) were extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor. Pediatric Patients (6 to 17 years) with Autistic Disorder The following findings are based on two 8 week, placebo-controlled trials in which oral aripiprazole was administered in doses of 2 to 15 mg/day. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazole-treated and placebo-treated pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) was 10% and 8%, respectively.

Dose-Related Adverse Reactions Schizophrenia Dose response relationships for the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were evaluated from four trials in adult patients with schizophrenia comparing various fixed doses (2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg/day) of oral aripiprazole to placebo. This analysis, stratified by study, indicated that the only adverse reaction to have a possible dose response relationship, and then most prominent only with 30 mg, was somnolence [including sedation]; (incidences were placebo, 7.1%; 10 mg, 8.5%; 15 mg, 8.7%; 20 mg, 7.5%; 30 mg, 12.6%). In the study of pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia, three common adverse reactions appeared to have a possible dose response relationship: extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were placebo, 5%; 10 mg, 13%; 30 mg, 21.6%); somnolence (incidences were placebo, 6%; 10 mg, 11%; 30 mg, 21.6%); and tremor (incidences were placebo, 2%; 10 mg, 2%; 30 mg, 11.8%). Autistic Disorder In a study of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with autistic disorder, one common adverse reaction had a possible dose response relationship: fatigue (incidences were placebo, 0%; 5 mg, 3.8%; 10 mg, 22%; 15 mg, 18.5%). Tourette\u2019s Disorder In a study of pediatric patients (7 to 17 years of age) with Tourette\u2019s disorder, no common adverse reaction(s) had a dose response relationship. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Schizophrenia In short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia in adults, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazole-treated patients was 13% vs. 12% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole-treated patients was 8% vs. 4% for placebo. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazole-treated patients was 25% vs. 7% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole-treated patients was 9% vs. 6% for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials was collected on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias). In the adult schizophrenia trials, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo, with the exception of the Barnes Akathisia Scale (aripiprazole, 0.08; placebo, \u20130.05). In the pediatric (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia trial, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo, with the exception of the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (aripiprazole, 0.24; placebo, \u20130.29). Similarly, in a long-term (26 week), placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia in adults, objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias) did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo. Autistic Disorder In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in autistic disorder in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazole-treated patients was 18% vs. 2% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole-treated patients was 3% vs. 9% for placebo. In the pediatric (6 to 17 years) short-term autistic disorder trials, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale showed a significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo (Aripiprazole, 0.1; placebo, \u2013 0.4). Changes in the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the aripiprazole and placebo groups. Tourette\u2019s Disorder In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in Tourette\u2019s disorder in pediatric patients (6 to 18 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazole-treated patients was 7% vs. 6% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole-treated patients was 4% vs. 6% for placebo. In the pediatric (6 to 18 years) short-term Tourette\u2019s disorder trials, changes in the Simpson Angus Rating Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale and Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scale were not clinically meaningfully different for aripiprazole and placebo. Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions in Long-Term, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials The adverse reactions reported in a 26 week, double-blind trial comparing oral aripiprazole and placebo in patients with schizophrenia were generally consistent with those reported in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials, except for a higher incidence of tremor [8% (12/153) for aripiprazole tablets vs. 2% (3/153) for placebo]. In this study, the majority of the cases of tremor were of mild intensity (8/12 mild and 4/12 moderate), occurred early in therapy (9/12 \u226449 days), and were of limited duration (7/12 \u226410 days). Tremor infrequently led to discontinuation (<1%) of aripiprazole tablets. In addition, in a long-term (52 weeks), active-controlled study, the incidence of tremor was 5% (40/859) for aripiprazole. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trial Evaluation of Aripiprazole The following listing does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are categorized by body system according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients: Adults - Oral Administration \u2022 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: rare - thrombocytopenia \u2022 Cardiac Disorders: infrequent - bradycardia, palpitations, rare - atrial flutter, cardio-respiratory arrest, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary failure \u2022 Eye Disorders: infrequent - photophobia; rare - diplopia \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: infrequent - gastroesophageal reflux disease \u2022 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:frequent - asthenia; infrequent - peripheral edema, chest pain; rare - face edema \u2022 Hepatobiliary Disorders: rare - hepatitis, jaundice \u2022 Immune System Disorders: rare - hypersensitivity \u2022 Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications: infrequent - fall; rare \u2013 heat stroke \u2022 Investigations: frequent \u2013 blood prolactin decreased, weight decreased, infrequent - hepatic enzyme increased, blood glucose increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased; rare - blood prolactin increased, blood urea increased, blood creatinine increased, blood bilirubin increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, glycosylated hemoglobin increased \u2022 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: frequent - anorexia; rare - hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia \u2022 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: infrequent - muscular weakness, muscle tightness; rare - rhabdomyolysis, mobility decreased \u2022 Nervous System Disorders: infrequent - parkinsonism, memory impairment, cogwheel rigidity, hypokinesia, bradykinesia; rare - akinesia, myoclonus, coordination abnormal, speech disorder, Grand Mal convulsion; <1/10,000 patients \u2013 choreoathetosis \u2022 Psychiatric Disorders: infrequent - aggression, loss of libido, delirium; rare - libido increased, anorgasmia, tic, homicidal ideation, catatonia, sleep walking \u2022 Renal and Urinary Disorders: rare - urinary retention, nocturia \u2022 Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: infrequent - erectile dysfunction; rare - gynaecomastia, menstruation irregular, amenorrhea, breast pain, priapism \u2022 Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: infrequent - nasal congestion, dyspnea \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: infrequent - rash, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia; rare - urticaria \u2022 Vascular Disorders: infrequent - hypotension, hypertension Pediatric Patients - Oral Administration Most adverse events observed in the pooled database of 1,686 pediatric patients, aged 6 to 18 years, were also observed in the adult population.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: occurrences of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, laryngospasm, pruritus/urticaria, or oropharyngeal spasm), blood glucose fluctuation, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), hiccups, oculogyric crisis, and pathological gambling.",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Dosage adjustment due to drug interactions (7.1): Factors Dosage Adjustments for Aripiprazole Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Administer half of usual dose Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of usual dose Strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer half of usual dose Strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of usual dose Strong CYP3A4 inducers Double usual dose over 1 to 2 weeks 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Aripiprazole Table 25: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Aripiprazole: Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale Clinical Recommendation Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) or strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) The concomitant use of aripiprazole with strong CYP 3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors increased the exposure of aripiprazole compared to the use of aripiprazole alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. With concomitant use of aripiprazole with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or CYP2D6 inhibitor, reduce the aripiprazole dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin) The concomitant use of aripiprazole and carbamazepine decreased the exposure of aripiprazole compared to the use of aripiprazole alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. With concomitant use of aripiprazole with a strong CYP3A4 inducer, consider increasing the aripiprazole dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Antihypertensive Drugs Due to its alpha adrenergic antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents. Monitor blood pressure and adjust dose accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) The intensity of sedation was greater with the combination of oral aripiprazole and lorazepam as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. The orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Monitor sedation and blood pressure. Adjust dose accordingly. 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with Aripiprazole Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine, valproate, lithium, lorazepam. In addition, no dosage adjustment is necessary for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or venlafaxine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, warfarin, escitalopram), or CYP3A4 (e.g., dextromethorphan) when co-administered with aripiprazole. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, lorazepam, or sertraline when co-administered with aripiprazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Aripiprazole is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to aripiprazole. Reactions have ranged from pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to aripiprazole (4)",
    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visit http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/ . Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations) . Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during organogenesis in rats and/or rabbits at doses 10 and 19 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, produced fetal death, decreased fetal weight, undescended testicles, delayed skeletal ossification, skeletal abnormalities, and diaphragmatic hernia. Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area, produced prolonged gestation, stillbirths, decreased pup weight, and decreased pup survival (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. A prospective, longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressants. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Human Data Published data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy do not report a clear association with antipsychotics and major birth defects. A retrospective study from a Medicaid database of 9258 women exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy did not indicate an overall increased risk for major birth defects. Animal Data In animal studies, aripiprazole demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. In pregnant rats treated orally with aripiprazole during organogenesis at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3 and 10 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, a slight prolongation of gestation and delay in fetal development, as evidenced by decreased fetal weight and undescended testes, were observed at 10 times the MRHD. Delayed skeletal ossification was observed at 3 and 10 times the MRHD. Delivered offspring had increased incidences of hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and diaphragmatic hernia were observed at 10 times the MRHD (the other dose groups were not examined for these findings). Postnatally, delayed vaginal opening was seen at 3 and 10 times the MRHD. Impaired reproductive performance (decreased fertility rate, corpora lutea, implants, live fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss, likely mediated through effects on female offspring) were observed at 10 times the MRHD; however, there was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. In pregnant rats injected intravenously with aripiprazole during organogenesis at doses of 3, 9, and 27 mg/kg/day, which are 1, 3, and 9 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, decreased fetal weight and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at 9 times the MRHD; this dose also caused maternal toxicity. In pregnant rabbits treated orally with aripiprazole during organogenesis at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day which are 6, 19, and 65 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, decreased maternal food consumption, and increased abortions as well as increased fetal mortality were observed at 65 times the MRHD. Decreased fetal weight and increased incidence of fused sternebrae were observed at 19 and 65 times the MRHD. In pregnant rabbits injected intravenously with aripiprazole during organogenesis at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day, which are 2, 6, and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, decreased fetal weight, increased fetal abnormalities (primarily skeletal), and decreased fetal skeletal ossificationwere observed at 19 times the MRHD; this dose also caused maternal toxicity. The fetal no-effect dose was 10 mg/kg/day, which is 6 times the MRHD. In rats treated orally with aripiprazole peri- and postnatally from gestation Day 17 through postpartum Day 21 at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day which are 1, 3, and 10 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area slight maternal toxicity and slightly prolonged gestation were observed at 10 times the MRHD. An increase in stillbirths and, decreases in pup weight (persisting into adulthood) and survival were also seen at this dose. In rats injected intravenously with aripiprazole from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 20 at doses of 3, 8, and 20 mg/kg/day, which are 1, 3, and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, increased stillbirths were observed at 3 and 6 times the MRHD; and decreases in early postnatal pup weight and survival were observed at 6 times the MRHD; these doses also caused some maternal toxicity. There were no effects on postnatal behavioral and reproductive development.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in pediatric patients, 10 to 17 years of age, were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Schizophrenia Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with schizophrenia were established in a 6 week, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 202 pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Bipolar I Disorder Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients demonstrating irritability associated with autistic disorder were established in two 8 week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 212 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years [see Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.4)] . A maintenance trial was conducted in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with irritability associated with autistic disorder. The first phase of this trial was an open-label, flexibly dosed (aripiprazole 2 to 15 mg/day) phase in which patients were stabilized (defined as >25% improvement on the ABC-I subscale, and a CGI-I rating of \u201cmuch improved\u201d or \u201cvery much improved\u201d) on aripiprazole for 12 consecutive weeks. Overall, 85 patients were stabilized and entered the second, 16 week, double-blind phase where they were randomized to either continue aripiprazole treatment or switch to placebo. In this trial, the efficacy of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder was not established. Tourette\u2019s Disorder Safety and effectiveness of aripiprazole in pediatric patients with Tourette\u2019s Disorder were established in one 8 week (aged 7 to 17 years) and one 10 week trial (aged 6 to 18 years) in 194 pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated. Juvenile Animal Studies Aripiprazole in juvenile rats caused mortality, CNS clinical signs, impaired memory and learning, and delayed sexual maturation when administered at oral doses of 10, 20, 40 mg/kg/day from weaning (21 days old) through maturity (80 days old). At 40 mg/kg/day, mortality, decreased activity, splayed hind limbs, hunched posture, ataxia, tremors and other CNS signs were observed in both genders. In addition, delayed sexual maturation was observed in males. At all doses and in a dose-dependent manner, impaired memory and learning, increased motor activity, and histopathology changes in the pituitary (atrophy), adrenals (adrenocortical hypertrophy), mammary glands (hyperplasia and increased secretion), and female reproductive organs (vaginal mucification, endometrial atrophy, decrease in ovarian corpora lutea) were observed. The changes in female reproductive organs were considered secondary to the increase in prolactin serum levels. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) could not be determined and, at the lowest tested dose of 10 mg/kg/day, there is no safety margin relative to the systemic exposures (AUC 0-24 ) for aripiprazole or its major active metabolite in adolescents at the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 15 mg/day. All drug-related effects were reversible after a 2 month recovery period, and most of the drug effects in juvenile rats were also observed in adult rats from previously conducted studies. Aripiprazole in juvenile dogs (2 months old) caused CNS clinical signs of tremors, hypoactivity, ataxia, recumbency and limited use of hind limbs when administered orally for 6 months at 3, 10, 30 mg/kg/day. Mean body weight and weight gain were decreased up to 18% in females in all drug groups relative to control values. A NOAEL could not be determined and, at the lowest tested dose of 3 mg/kg/day, there is no safety margin relative to the systemic exposures (AUC 0-24 ) for aripiprazole or its major active metabolite in adolescents at the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 15 mg/day. All drug-related effects were reversible after a 2 month recovery period.",

Of the 13,543 patients treated with oral aripiprazole in clinical trials, 1,073 (8%) were \u226565 years old and 799 (6%) were \u226575 years old. Placebo-controlled studies of oral aripiprazole in schizophrenia or other indications did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].",

Veratrum Alkaloids Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum alkaloids. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. Amphetamines may interfere with urinary steroid determinations. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in which d,l-amphetamine (enantiomer ratio of 1:1) was administered to mice and rats in the diet for 2 years at doses of up to 30 mg/kg/day in male mice, 19 mg/kg/day in female mice, and 5 mg/kg/day in male and female rats. These doses are approximately 2.4, 1.5, and 0.8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg/day [child] on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. Amphetamine, in the enantiomer ratio present in dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate tablets (immediate-release) (d- to l- ratio of 3:1), was not clastogenic in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test in vivo and was negative when tested in the E. coli component of the Ames test in vitro . D, l-Amphetamine (1:1 enantiomer ratio) has been reported to produce a positive response in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test, an equivocal response in the Ames test, and negative responses in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberration assays. Amphetamine, in the enantiomer ratio present in dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate tablets (immediate-release)(d- to l- ratio of 3:1), did not adversely affect fertility or early embryonic development in the rat at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg/day on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis). Pregnancey Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Amphetamine, in the enantiomer ratio present in dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate tablets (d- to l- ratio of 3:1), had no apparent effects on embryofetal morphological development or survival when orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 6 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 1.5 and 8 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg/day [child] on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. Fetal malformations and death have been reported in mice following parenteral administration of d-amphetamine doses of 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times that of a human dose of 30 mg/day [child] on a mg/m 2 basis) or greater to pregnant animals. Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity. A number of studies in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine (d- or d,l-), at doses similar to those used clinically, can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. There has been one report of severe congenital bony deformity, tracheo-esophageal fistula, and anal atresia (vater association) in a baby born to a woman who took dextroamphetamine sulfate with lovastatin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Amphetamines should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight. Also, these infants may experience symptoms of withdrawal as demonstrated by dysphoria, including agitation, and significant lassitude. Usage in Nursing Mothers Amphetamines are excreted in human milk. Mothers taking amphetamines should be advised to refrain from nursing. Pediatric Use Long-term effects of amphetamines in children have not been well established. Amphetamines are not recommended for use in children under 3 years of age with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder described under I NDICATIONS AND USAGE .

    "warnings_and_cautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of AIMOVIG and initiate appropriate therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur within hours to more than one week after administration. ( 5.1 ) Constipation with Serious Complications: Serious complications of constipation may occur. ( 5.2 ) Hypertension: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. ( 5.3 ) Raynaud's Phenomenon: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon may occur. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, have been reported with AIMOVIG in postmarketing experience. Most hypersensitivity reactions were not serious and occurred within hours of administration, although some occurred more than one week after administration. If a serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of AIMOVIG and initiate appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.2 Constipation with Serious Complications Constipation with serious complications has been reported following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. There were cases that required hospitalization, including cases where surgery was necessary. In a majority of these cases, the onset of constipation was reported after the first dose of AIMOVIG; however, patients have also presented with constipation later on in treatment. AIMOVIG was discontinued in most reported cases of constipation with serious complications. Constipation was one of the most common (up to 3%) adverse reactions reported in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor patients treated with AIMOVIG for severe constipation and manage as clinically appropriate [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . The concurrent use of medications associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for more severe constipation and the potential for constipation-related complications. 5.3 Hypertension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. Many of the patients had pre-existing hypertension or risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring pharmacological treatment and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment but was most frequently reported within seven days of dose administration. In the majority of the cases, the onset or worsening of hypertension was reported after the first dose. AIMOVIG was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with AIMOVIG for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of AIMOVIG is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology. 5.4 Raynaud's Phenomenon Development of Raynaud's phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including AIMOVIG. In reported cases with monoclonal antibody CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 71 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. AIMOVIG should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",

The safety of AIMOVIG has been evaluated in 2537 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of AIMOVIG, representing 3040.2 patient-years of exposure. Of these, 2271 patients were exposed to 70 mg or 140 mg once monthly for at least 6 months, 1305 patients were exposed for at least 12 months, and 216 patients were exposed through 5 years. In placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3) of 2184 patients, 787 patients received at least one dose of AIMOVIG 70 mg once monthly, 507 patients received at least one dose of AIMOVIG 140 mg once monthly, and 890 patients received placebo during 3 months or 6 months of double-blind treatment [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Approximately 84% were female, 91% were white, and the mean age was 42 years at study entry. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3% and more often than placebo) in the migraine studies were injection site reactions and constipation. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred during the first 3 months in the migraine studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

The most frequent injection site reactions were injection site pain, injection site erythema, and injection site pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of AIMOVIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Patients should be encouraged to enroll by calling 1-833-244-4083 or visiting https://www.genesispregnancyregistry.com/. Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of AIMOVIG in pregnant women. No adverse effects on offspring were observed when pregnant monkeys were administered erenumab-aooe throughout gestation [see Data ]. Serum erenumab-aooe exposures in pregnant monkeys were greater than those in humans at clinical doses. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy. Data Animal Data In a study in which female monkeys were administered erenumab-aooe (0 or 50 mg/kg) twice weekly by subcutaneous injection throughout pregnancy (gestation day 20-22 to parturition), no adverse effects on offspring were observed. Serum erenumab-aooe exposures (AUC) in pregnant monkeys were approximately 20 times that in humans at a dose of 140 mg once monthly.",

Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets has been shown to decrease sleep latency for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were 4\u20135 weeks in duration with the final formal assessments of sleep latency performed at the end of treatment. Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor positive modulator, is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation.

    "dosage_and_administration": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest dose effective for the patient and must not exceed a total of 10 mg daily ( 2.1 ) Treatment should be as short as possible ( 2.1 ) Recommended initial dose is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men, immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening ( 2.1 ) Geriatric patients and patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment: Recommended dose is 5 mg for men and women ( 2.2 ) Lower doses of CNS depressants may be necessary when taken concomitantly with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets ( 2.3 ) The effect of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets may be slowed if taken with or immediately after a meal ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adults Use the lowest effective dose for the patient. The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 5 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 10 mg. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next-day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The total dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should be taken as a single dose and should not be readministered during the same night. The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because Zolpidem clearance is lower in women. Long-term use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is not recommended. Treatment should be as short as possible. Extended treatment should not take place without re-evaluation of the patient's status because the risk of abuse and dependence increase with the duration of treatment [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] 2.2 Special Populations Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of Zolpidem tartrate. The recommended dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects. The recommended dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Avoid Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.3 Use with CNS Depressants Dosage adjustment may be necessary when Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is combined with other CNS-depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.7 )]. 2.4 Administration The effect of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately after a meal.",

WARNING: COMPLEX SLEEP BEHAVIORS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Complex sleep behaviors including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets . Some of these events may result in serious injuries, including death. Discontinue Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior. ( 4 , 5.1 )",
    "warnings_and_cautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CNS-Depressant Effects: Impairs alertness and motor coordination including risk of morning impairment. Risk increases with dose and use with other CNS depressants and alcohol. Caution patients against driving and other activities requiring mental alertness the morning after use. Instruct patients on correct use. ( 5.2 ) Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses: Re-evaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of use. ( 5.3 ) Severe Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions: Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported. Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur. ( 5.4 ) Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes: Changes including decreased inhibition, bizarre behavior, agitation, and depersonalization have been reported. Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes. ( 5.5 ) Depression: Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur. Prescribe the least amount of tablets feasible to avoid intentional overdose. ( 5.6 ) Respiratory Depression: Consider this risk before prescribing in patients with compromised respiratory function. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 5.8 ) Withdrawal Effects: Symptoms may occur with rapid dose reduction or discontinuation. ( 5.9 , 9.3 ) 5.1 Complex Sleep Behaviors Complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake, may occur following the first or any subsequent use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets. Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors. Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome. Other complex sleep behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have also been reported. Patients usually do not remember these events. Postmarketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets alone at recommended doses, with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants [see Drug Interaction ( 7.1 )]. Discontinue Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.2 CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets, like other sedative-hypnotic drugs, has CNS-depressant effects. Coadministration with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol) increases the risk of CNS depression [see Drug Interaction ( 7.1 )]. Dosage adjustments of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and of other concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects. The use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets with other sedative-hypnotics (including other zolpidem products) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment, including impaired driving, is increased if Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if a higher than the recommended dose is taken; if coadministered with other CNS depressants or alcohol; or if coadministered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpidem. Patients should be warned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is taken in these circumstances [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] Vehicle drivers and machine operators should be warned that, as with other hypnotics, there may be a possible risk of adverse reactions including drowsiness, prolonged reaction time, dizziness, sleepiness, blurred/double vision, reduced alertness, and impaired driving the morning after therapy. In order to minimize this risk a full night of sleep (7\u20138 hours) is recommended. Because Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls. 5.3 Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem. 5.4 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the throat, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug. 5.5 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative/hypnotics, including Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets. Some of these changes included decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, agitation and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported. In controlled trials of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets 10 mg taken at bedtime <1% of adults with insomnia reported hallucinations. In a clinical trial, 7% of pediatric patients treated with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets 0.25 mg/kg taken at bedtime reported hallucinations versus 0% treated with placebo [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. There have been postmarketing reports of delirium with zolpidem use [Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation. 5.6 Use in Patients with Depression In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, worsening of depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), have been reported. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdosage is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time. 5.7 Respiratory Depression Although studies with 10 mg zolpidem tartrate did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses in healthy subjects or in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a reduction in the Total Arousal Index, together with a reduction in lowest oxygen saturation and increase in the times of oxygen desaturation below 80% and 90%, was observed in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea when treated with zolpidem compared to placebo. Since sedative-hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive, precautions should be taken if Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function or concomitant use with opioids or other CNS depressants. Postmarketing reports of respiratory insufficiency in patients receiving 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate, most of whom had pre-existing respiratory impairment, have been reported. The risk of respiratory depression should be considered prior to prescribing Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in patients with respiratory impairment including sleep apnea and myasthenia gravis or with concomitant opioid use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.8 Precipitation of Hepatic Encephalopathy Drugs affecting GABA receptors, such as zolpidem tartrate, have been associated with precipitation of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with hepatic insufficiency. In addition, patients with hepatic insufficiency do not clear zolpidem tartrate as rapidly as patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.9 Withdrawal Effects There have been reports of withdrawal signs and symptoms following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem. Monitor patients for tolerance, abuse, and dependence [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 , 9.3 )]",

    "abuse": "9.2 Abuse Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of Zolpidem Tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while Zolpidem Tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo. Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of Zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving Zolpidem or any other hypnotic.",
    "dependence": "9.3 Dependence Use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets may lead to the development of physical and/or psychological dependence. The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment. The risk of abuse and dependence is also greater in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with current or past alcohol or drug abuse. Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist. Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, convulsions, and delirium. The following adverse events, which are considered to meet the DSM-III-R criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal, were reported during clinical trials with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal discomfort. These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or less. However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence, if any, of dependence during treatment at recommended doses. There have been postmarketing reports of abuse, dependence and withdrawal with zolpidem.",

Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from U.S. trials were daytime drowsiness (0.5%), dizziness (0.4%), headache (0.5%), nausea (0.6%), and vomiting (0.5%). Approximately 4% of 1,959 patients who received Zolpidem at all doses (1 to 50 mg) in similar foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from these trials were daytime drowsiness (1.1%), dizziness/vertigo (0.8%), amnesia (0.5%), nausea (0.5%), headache (0.4%), and falls (0.4%). Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-treated patients were given Zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double-blind treatment with Zolpidem (n=95) were associated with impaired concentration, continuing or aggravated depression, and manic reaction; one patient treated with placebo (n=97) was discontinued after an attempted suicide. Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Trials During short-term treatment (up to 10 nights) with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets at doses up to 10 mg, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo-treated patients were drowsiness (reported by 2% of Zolpidem patients), dizziness (1%), and diarrhea (1%). During longer-term treatment (28 to 35 nights) with Zolpidem at doses up to 10 mg, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo-treated patients were dizziness (5%) and drugged feelings (3%). Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of \u22651% in Controlled Trials The following tables enumerate treatment-emergent adverse reactions frequencies that were observed at an incidence equal to 1% or greater among patients with insomnia who received Zolpidem Tartrate and at a greater incidence than placebo in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Events reported by investigators were classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms for the purpose of establishing event frequencies. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied. The following table was derived from results of 11 placebo-controlled short-term U.S. efficacy trials involving Zolpidem in doses ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg. The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest dose recommended for use. Table 1: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 10 Nights (percentage of patients reporting) Body System Adverse Event Reactions reported by at least 1% of patients treated with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and at a greater frequency than placebo. Zolpidem (\u226410 mg) (N=685) Placebo (N=473) Central and Peripheral Nervous System Headache 7 6 Drowsiness 2 - Dizziness 1 - Gastrointestinal System Diarrhea 1 - The following table was derived from results of three placebo-controlled long-term efficacy trials involving Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets. These trials involved patients with chronic insomnia who were treated for 28 to 35 nights with Zolpidem at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg. The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest dose recommended for use. The table includes only adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 1% for Zolpidem patients.

Adverse Event Incidence Across the Entire Preapproval Database Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets was administered to 3,660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportions of the 3,660 individuals exposed to Zolpidem, at all doses, who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving Zolpidem. All reported treatment-emergent adverse events are included, except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo-controlled studies, those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative, and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported did occur during treatment with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets, they were not necessarily caused by it. Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1/100 subjects; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Liver and biliary system: acute hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed liver injury with or without jaundice (i.e., bilirubin >2 \u00d7 ULN, alkaline phosphatase \u22652 \u00d7 ULN, transaminase \u22655 \u00d7 ULN). Psychiatric disorders: delirium",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants, including alcohol: Possible adverse additive CNS- depressant effects ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Opioids: Concomitant use may increase risk of respiratory depression ( 5.7 , 7.1 ) Imipramine: Decreased alertness observed ( 7.1 ) Chlorpromazine: Impaired alertness and psychomotor performance observed ( 7.1 ) CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin or St. John's wort): Combination use may decrease effect ( 7.2 ) Ketoconazole: Combination use may increase effect ( 7.2 ) 7.1 CNS-Active Drugs CNS Depressants Coadministration of Zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression. Concomitant use of Zolpidem with these drugs may increase drowsiness and psychomotor impairment, including impaired driving ability [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )]. Zolpidem Tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs. Alcohol An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral Zolpidem was demonstrated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] Opioids The concomitant use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets with opioids may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and opioids [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Imipramine, Chlorpromazine Imipramine in combination with Zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with Zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Sertraline Concomitant administration of Zolpidem and sertraline increases exposure to Zolpidem [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Fluoxetine After multiple doses of Zolpidem Tartrate and fluoxetine an increase in the Zolpidem half-life (17%) was observed. There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Haloperidol A study involving haloperidol and Zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect exposure to Zolpidem. The effect of drugs that induce or inhibit other P450 enzymes on the exposure to Zolpidem is not known. CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin Rifampin, a CYP3A4 inducer, significantly reduced the exposure to and the pharmacodynamic effects of Zolpidem. Use of Rifampin in combination with Zolpidem may decrease the efficacy of Zolpidem and is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. St. John's wort Use of St. John's wort, a CYP3A4 inducer, in combination with Zolpidem may decrease blood levels of Zolpidem and is not recommended. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole Ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the exposure to and pharmacodynamic effects of Zolpidem. Consideration should be given to using a lower dose of Zolpidem when a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and Zolpidem are given together [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is contraindicated in patients who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] with known hypersensitivity to zolpidem. Observed reactions include anaphylaxis and angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Patients who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets ( 4 ) Known hypersensitivity to Zolpidem ( 4 )",
    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using Zolpidem late in the third trimester of pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Clinical Considerations and Data]. Published data on the use of Zolpidem during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with Zolpidem and major birth defects [see Data]. Oral administration of Zolpidem to pregnant rats and rabbits did not indicate a risk for adverse effects on fetal development at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Zolpidem crosses the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets during pregnancy and labor for signs of excess sedation, hypotonia, and respiratory depression and manage accordingly. Data Human data Published data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports on the use of Zolpidem during pregnancy do not report a clear association with Zolpidem and major birth defects. There are limited postmarketing reports of severe to moderate cases of respiratory depression that occurred after birth in neonates whose mothers had taken Zolpidem during pregnancy. These cases required artificial ventilation or intratracheal intubation. The majority of neonates recovered within hours to a few weeks after birth once treated. Zolpidem has been shown to cross the placenta. Animal data Oral administration of Zolpidem to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg/day, which are approximately 5, 25, and 120 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day (8 mg Zolpidem base) based on mg/m 2 body surface area, caused delayed fetal development (incomplete fetal skeletal ossification) at maternally toxic (ataxia) doses 25 and 120 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Oral administration of Zolpidem to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at 1, 4, and 16 mg base/kg/day, which are approximately 2.5, 10, and 40 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day (8 mg Zolpidem base) based on mg/m 2 body surface area caused embryo-fetal death and delayed fetal development (incomplete fetal skeletal ossification) at a maternally toxic (decreased body weight gain) dose 40 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Oral administration of Zolpidem to pregnant rats from day 15 of gestation through lactation at 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg/day, which are approximately 5, 25, and 120 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day (8 mg Zolpidem base) based on mg/m 2 body surface area, delayed offspring growth and decreased survival at doses 25 and 120 times, respectively, the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is not recommended for use in children. Safety and effectiveness of Zolpidem in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. In an 8-week study, in pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) with insomnia associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) an oral solution of Zolpidem Tartrate dosed at 0.25 mg/kg at bedtime did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo. Psychiatric and nervous system disorders comprised the most frequent (>5%) treatment emergent adverse reactions observed with Zolpidem versus placebo and included dizziness (23.5% vs 1.5%), headache (12.5% vs 9.2%), and hallucinations were reported in 7% of the pediatric patients who received Zolpidem; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )].

Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if IMNM is suspected ( 5.2 ). Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin calcium ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Atorvastatin calcium may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including atorvastatin. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher atorvastatin dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6 ) ]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Atorvastatin exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin is not recommended. Atorvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with lipid modifying doses (>1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Discontinue atorvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if atorvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the atorvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue atorvastatin if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4) ]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin. 5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including atorvastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. 5.5 Increased Risk of Hemorrhagic Stroke in Patients on Atorvastatin Calcium 80 mg with Recent Hemorrhagic Stroke In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial where 2365 adult patients, without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Consider the risk/benefit of use of atorvastatin 80 mg in patients with recent hemorrhagic stroke.",

In the atorvastatin calcium placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 atorvastatin calcium vs. 7311 placebo; age range 10 to 93 years, 39% women, 91% White, 3% Black, 2% Asian, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in \u2265 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium (n=8755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 2% in Patients Atorvastatin Calcium- Treated with any Dose and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction % Placebo N=7311 % 10 mg N=3908 % 20 mg N=188 % 40 mg N=604 % 80 mg N=4055 % Any dose N=8755 Nasopharyngitis 8.2 12.9 5.3 7.0 4.2 8.3 Arthralgia 6.5 8.9 11.7 10.6 4.3 6.9 Diarrhea 6.3 7.3 6.4 14.1 5.2 6.8 Pain in extremity 5.9 8.5 3.7 9.3 3.1 6.0 Urinary tract infection 5.6 6.9 6.4 8.0 4.1 5.7 Dyspepsia 4.3 5.9 3.2 6.0 3.3 4.7 Nausea 3.5 3.7 3.7 7.1 3.8 4.0 Musculoskeletal pain 3.6 5.2 3.2 5.1 2.3 3.8 Muscle spasms 3.0 4.6 4.8 5.1 2.4 3.6 Myalgia 3.1 3.6 5.9 8.4 2.7 3.5 Insomnia 2.9 2.8 1.1 5.3 2.8 3.0 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 2.1 3.9 1.6 2.8 0.7 2.3 Other adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Body as a whole: malaise, pyrexia Digestive system: abdominal discomfort, eructation, flatulence, hepatitis, cholestasis Musculoskeletal system: musculoskeletal pain, muscle fatigue, neck pain, joint swelling Metabolic and nutritional system: transaminases increase, liver function test abnormal, blood alkaline phosphatase increase, creatine phosphokinase increase, hyperglycemia Nervous system: nightmare Respiratory system: epistaxis Skin and appendages: urticaria Special senses: vision blurred, tinnitus Urogenital system: white blood cells urine positive Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Persistent elevations in serum transaminases, defined as more than 3 times the ULN and occurring on 2 or more occasions, occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver enzyme tests in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent liver enzyme elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin calcium. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT, [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] 10,001 patients (age range 29 to 78 years, 19% women; 94% White, 3% Black, 1% Asian, 2% other) with clinically evident CHD were treated with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg daily (n=5006) or atorvastatin calcium 80 mg daily (n=4995). In the high-dose atorvastatin calcium group, there were more patients with serious adverse reactions (1.8%) and discontinuations due to adverse reactions (9.9%) as compared to the low-dose group (1.4%; 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (\u22653 x ULN twice within 4 to10 days) occurred in 1.3% of individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in 0.2% of individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK (\u2265 10 x ULN) were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin group (0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (0.1%). Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL, 4731 subjects (age range 21 to 92 years, 40% women; 93% White, 3% Black, 1% Asian, 3% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months were treated with atorvastatin calcium 80 mg (n=2365) or placebo (n=2366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years. There was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations (\u2265 3 x ULN twice within 4 to 10 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>10 x ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 6.1% of subjects in the atorvastatin group and 3.8% of subjects in the placebo group. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin calcium 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (9.2% vs. 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (2.3% vs. 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Patients who entered the trial with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (16% atorvastatin calcium vs. 4% placebo). Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies of Atorvastatin Calcium in Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 26-week controlled study in pediatric patients with HeFH (ages 10 years to 17 years) (n=140, 31% female; 92% White, 1.6% Blacks, 1.6% Asians, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium 10 to 20 mg daily, as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels, was generally similar to that of placebo [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin calcium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: pancreatitis General disorders: fatigue Hepatobiliary Disorders: fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune system disorders : anaphylaxis Injury: tendon rupture Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: rhabdomyolysis, myositis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use. Nervous system disorders: dizziness, peripheral neuropathy. There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). Psychiatric disorders: depression Respiratory disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis)",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for details regarding concomitant use of atorvastatin calcium with other drugs or grapefruit juice that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis ( 2.5 , 7.1 ). Rifampin: May reduce atorvastatin plasma concentrations. Administer simultaneously with atorvastatin calcium ( 7.2 ). Oral Contraceptives: May increase plasma levels of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; consider this effect when selecting an oral contraceptive (7.3 ). Digoxin: May increase digoxin plasma levels; monitor patients appropriately ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Drug Interactions that may Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Atorvastatin Calcium Atorvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, or BCRP). Atorvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 and transporters. Table 2 includes a list of drugs that may increase exposure to atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 2: Drug Interactions that may Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Atorvastatin Cyclosporine or Gemfibrozil Clinical Impact: Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin and cyclosporine, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Gemfibrozil may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with atorvastatin. Intervention: Concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with atorvastatin is not recommended. Anti-Viral Medications Clinical Impact: Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin with many anti-viral medications, which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or transporters (e.g., BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, MRP2, and/or OAT2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir with atorvastatin. Intervention: Concomitant use of tipranavir plus ritonavir or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin is not recommended. In patients taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, or simeprevir, consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use with atorvastatin. In patients taking saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, elbasvir plus grazoprevir or letermovir, do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg. In patients taking nelfinavir, do not exceed atorvastatin 40 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir with atorvastatin. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Examples: Tipranavir plus ritonavir, glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, simeprevir, saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, elbasvir plus grazoprevir, letermovir, nelfinavir, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Select Azole Antifungals or Macrolide Antibiotics Clinical Impact: Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin with select azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics, due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or transporters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: In patients taking clarithromycin or itraconazole, do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of other azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics with atorvastatin. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Examples: Erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. Niacin Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of lipid modifying dosages of niacin ( > 1 gram/day niacin) with atorvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using lipid modifying dosages of niacin concomitantly with atorvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil) Clinical Impact: Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with atorvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with atorvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Colchicine Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with atorvastatin. Intervention: Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of colchicine with atorvastatin. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Grapefruit Juice Clinical Impact: Grapefruit juice consumption, especially excessive consumption, more than 1.2 liters/daily, can raise the plasma levels of atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Intervention: Avoid intake of large quantities of grapefruit juice, more than 1.2 liters daily, when taking atorvastatin. 7.2 Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to Atorvastatin Calcium Table 3 presents drug interactions that may decrease exposure to atorvastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 3: Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to Atorvastatin Rifampin Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with rifampin, an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 and inhibitor of OATP1B1, can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. Intervention: Administer atorvastatin and rifampin simultaneously. 7.3 Atorvastatin Calcium Effects on Other Drugs Table 4 presents Atorvastatin\u2019s effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 4: Atorvastatin Effects on Other Drugs Oral Contraceptives Clinical Impact: Co-administration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider this when selecting an oral contraceptive for patients taking atorvastatin. Digoxin Clinical Impact: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Monitor patients taking digoxin appropriately.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity to atorvastatin or any excipients in atorvastatin calcium. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis ( 4 ). Hypersensitivity to atorvastatin or any excipient in atorvastatin calcium ( 4 ).",
    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue atorvastatin when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. atorvastatin decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, atorvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with atorvastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered atorvastatin at doses that resulted in up to 30 and 20 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). In rats administered atorvastatin during gestation and lactation, decreased postnatal growth and development delay were observed at doses \u2265 6 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders \u2013 including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use \u2013 using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Atorvastatin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure at the MRHD based on surface area (mg/m 2 ). In rats, the maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight. At the maternally toxic doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits, there was increased post-implantation loss, and at 100 mg/kg/day fetal body weights were decreased. In a study in pregnant rats administered 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 20 (weaning), there was decreased survival at birth, postnatal day 4, weaning, and post-weaning in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mg/kg/day, a dose at which maternal toxicity was observed. Pup body weight was decreased through postnatal day 21 at 100 mg/kg/day, and through postnatal day 91 at 225 mg/kg/day. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mg/kg/day and acoustic startle at 225 mg/kg/day; pinnae detachment and eye-opening at 225 mg/kg/day). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mg/kg) and 22 times (225 mg/kg) the human exposure at the MRHD, based on AUC. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of atorvastatin calcium for this indication is based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 187 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. In this limited controlled trial, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the boys or girls, or on menstrual cycle length in girls. The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium as an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HoFH. Use of atorvastatin calcium for this indication is based on a trial without a concurrent control group in 8 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HoFH [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or HoFH, or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH or HoFH).",
    "geriatric_use": "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of atorvastatin calcium -treated patients in clinical trials, 15,813 (40%) were \u226565 years old and 2,800 (7%) were \u226575 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Advanced age (\u226565 years) is a risk factor for atorvastatin calcium -associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving atorvastatin calcium for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

    "mechanism_of_action": "12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which deutetrabenazine exerts its effects in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and chorea in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease is unknown but is believed to be related to its effect as a reversible depletor of monoamines (such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine) from nerve terminals. The major circulating metabolites (\u03b1-dihydrotetrabenazine [HTBZ] and \u03b2-HTBZ) of deutetrabenazine, are reversible inhibitors of VMAT2, resulting in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion of monoamine stores.",
    "boxed_warning": "WARNING: DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY IN PATIENTS WITH HUNTINGTON\u2019S DISEASE AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease. Anyone considering the use of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for treatment of chorea. Closely monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington\u2019s disease. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients who are suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. WARNING: DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY IN PATIENTS WITH HUNTINGTON\u2019S DISEASE See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

    "warnings_and_cautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT Prolongation: Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval ( 5.3 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Discontinue if this occurs ( 5.4 ) Akathisia, agitation, restlessness, and parkinsonism: Reduce dose or discontinue if this occurs ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Sedation/somnolence: May impair the patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate complex machinery ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Depression and Suicidality in Patients with Huntington\u2019s Disease Patients with Huntington\u2019s disease are at increased risk for depression, and suicidal ideation or behaviors (suicidality). AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may increase the risk for suicidality in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, suicidal ideation was reported by 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO, compared to no patients on placebo; no suicide attempts and no completed suicides were reported. Depression was reported by 4% of patients treated with AUSTEDO. When considering the use of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, the risk of suicidality should be balanced against the need for treatment of chorea. All patients treated with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO should be observed for new or worsening depression or suicidality. If depression or suicidality does not resolve, consider discontinuing treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risks of depression, worsening depression, and suicidality associated with AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO, and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Patients with Huntington\u2019s disease who express suicidal ideation should be evaluated immediately. 5.2 Clinical Worsening and Adverse Events in Patients with Huntington\u2019s Disease Huntington\u2019s disease is a progressive disorder characterized by changes in mood, cognition, chorea, rigidity, and functional capacity over time. VMAT2 inhibitors, including AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO, may cause a worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including sedation/somnolence, depression and suicidality, parkinsonism, akathisia, restlessness, and cognitive decline. It may be difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician to distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, the underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. 5.3 QTc Prolongation AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may prolong the QT interval, but the degree of QT prolongation is not clinically significant when AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is administered within the recommended dosage range [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission. While NMS has not been observed in patients receiving AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, it has been observed in patients receiving tetrabenazine (a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor). Clinicians should be alerted to the signs and symptoms associated with NMS. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. Recurrence of NMS has been reported with resumption of drug therapy. If treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence. 5.5 Akathisia, Agitation, and Restlessness AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may increase the risk of akathisia, agitation, and restlessness in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease and tardive dyskinesia. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease, akathisia, agitation, or restlessness was reported by 4% of patients treated with AUSTEDO, compared to 2% of patients on placebo; in patients with tardive dyskinesia, 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO and 1% of patients on placebo experienced these events. Patients receiving AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO should be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia during treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, the AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy. 5.6 Parkinsonism AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may cause parkinsonism in patients with Huntington\u2019s disease or tardive dyskinesia. Parkinsonism has also been observed with other VMAT2 inhibitors. Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington\u2019s disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between potential drug-induced parkinsonism and progression of underlying Huntington\u2019s disease. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington\u2019s disease. Postmarketing cases of parkinsonism in patients treated with AUSTEDO for tardive dyskinesia have been reported. Signs and symptoms in reported cases have included bradykinesia, gait disturbances, which led to falls in some cases, and the emergence or worsening of tremor. In most cases, the development of parkinsonism occurred within the first two weeks after starting or increasing the dose of AUSTEDO. In cases in which follow-up clinical information was available, parkinsonism was reported to resolve following discontinuation of AUSTEDO therapy. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, the AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy. 5.7 Sedation and Somnolence Sedation is a common dose-limiting adverse reaction of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining patients with Huntington\u2019s disease, 11% of AUSTEDO-treated patients reported somnolence compared with 4% of patients on placebo and 9% of AUSTEDO-treated patients reported fatigue compared with 4% of placebo-treated patients. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness to maintain the safety of themselves or others, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO and know how the drug affects them. 5.8 Hyperprolactinemia Serum prolactin levels were not evaluated in the AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO development program. Tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor, elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. Following administration of 25 mg of tetrabenazine to healthy volunteers, peak plasma prolactin levels increased 4- to 5-fold. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is being considered for a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence can be caused by elevated serum prolactin concentrations, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin concentrations for most patients is unknown. Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels (although not evaluated in the AUSTEDO XR, AUSTEDO, or tetrabenazine development programs) has been associated with low levels of estrogen and increased risk of osteoporosis. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO. 5.9 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues Since deutetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues, it could accumulate in these tissues over time. This raises the possibility that AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Neither ophthalmologic nor microscopic examination of the eye has been conducted in the chronic toxicity studies in a pigmented species such as dogs. Ophthalmologic monitoring in humans was inadequate to exclude the possibility of injury occurring after long-term exposure. The clinical relevance of deutetrabenazine\u2019s binding to melanin-containing tissues is unknown. Although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].",

The studies described below were conducted with AUSTEDO tablets; adverse reactions with AUSTEDO XR extended-release tablets are expected to be similar to AUSTEDO tablets. Patients with Huntington\u2019s Disease Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] was a randomized, 12-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease. A total of 45 patients received AUSTEDO, and 45 patients received placebo. Patients ranged in age between 23 and 74 years (mean 54 years); 56% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 8% of AUSTEDO-treated patients were somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue. Adverse reactions occurring in 4% or more of patients treated with AUSTEDO, and with a greater incidence than in patients on placebo, are summarized in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in Patients with Huntington's Disease (Study 1) Experienced by at Least 4% of Patients on AUSTEDO and with a Greater Incidence than on Placebo Adverse Reaction AUSTEDO (N = 45) % Placebo (N = 45) % Somnolence 11 4 Diarrhea 9 0 Dry mouth 9 7 Fatigue 9 4 Urinary tract infection 7 2 Insomnia 7 4 Anxiety 4 2 Constipation 4 2 Contusion 4 2 One or more adverse reactions resulted in a reduction of the dose of study medication in 7% of patients in Study 1. The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose reduction in patients receiving AUSTEDO was dizziness (4%). Agitation led to discontinuation in 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO in Study 1. Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia The data described below reflect 410 tardive dyskinesia patients participating in clinical trials. AUSTEDO was studied primarily in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials (fixed dose, dose escalation) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The population was 18 to 80 years of age, and had tardive dyskinesia and had concurrent diagnoses of mood disorder (33%) or schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (63%). In these studies, AUSTEDO was administered in doses ranging from 12-48 mg per day. All patients continued on previous stable regimens of antipsychotics; 71% and 14% respective atypical and typical antipsychotic medications at study entry. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 3% of AUSTEDO-treated patients and greater than placebo were nasopharyngitis and insomnia. The adverse reactions occurring in >2% or more patients treated with AUSTEDO (12-48 mg per day) and greater than in placebo patients in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with tardive dyskinesia (Study 1 and Study 2) are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Adverse Reactions in 2 Placebo-Controlled Tardive Dyskinesia Studies (Study 1 and Study 2) of 12-week Treatment on AUSTEDO Reported in at Least 2% of Patients and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction AUSTEDO (N=279) (%) Placebo (N=131) (%) Nasopharyngitis 4 2 Insomnia 4 1 Depression/ Dysthymic disorder 2 1 Akathisia/Agitation/Restlessness 2 1 One or more adverse reactions resulted in a reduction of the dose of study medication in 4% of AUSTEDO-treated patients and in 2% of placebo-treated patients.",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors: Maximum recommended dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is 36 mg per day ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Alcohol or other sedating drugs: May have additive sedation and somnolence ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors A reduction in AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose may be necessary when adding a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor in patients maintained on a stable dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure to the active dihydro-metabolites of deutetrabenazine by approximately 3-fold. The daily dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO should not exceed 36 mg per day in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Reserpine Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2 and the duration of its effect is several days. Prescribers should wait for chorea or dyskinesia to reemerge before administering AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO to help reduce the risk of overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should not be used concomitantly with reserpine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.4 Neuroleptic Drugs The risk of parkinsonism, NMS, and akathisia may be increased by concomitant use of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO with dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. 7.5 Alcohol or Other Sedating Drugs Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 7.6 Concomitant Tetrabenazine or Valbenazine AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients currently taking tetrabenazine or valbenazine. AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO may be initiated the day following discontinuation of tetrabenazine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients: With Huntington\u2019s disease who are suicidal, or have untreated or inadequately treated depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . With hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Taking reserpine. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] .

    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO in pregnant women. Administration of deutetrabenazine to rats during organogenesis produced no clear adverse effect on embryofetal development. However, administration of tetrabenazine to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in an increase in stillbirths and postnatal offspring mortality [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of deutetrabenazine (5, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) or tetrabenazine (30 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during organogenesis had no clear effect on embryofetal development. The highest dose tested was 6 times the maximum recommended human dose of 48 mg/day, on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. The effects of deutetrabenazine when administered during organogenesis to rabbits or during pregnancy and lactation to rats have not been assessed. Tetrabenazine had no effects on embryofetal development when administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. When tetrabenazine was administered to female rats (doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day) from the beginning of organogenesis through the lactation period, an increase in stillbirths and offspring postnatal mortality was observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg/day, and delayed pup maturation was observed at all doses.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use Chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s Disease and Tardive Dyskinesia The safety and effectiveness of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease or for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Tourette Syndrome The safety and effectiveness of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. Efficacy was not demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years with Tourette syndrome. One study evaluated fixed doses of deutetrabenazine over 8 weeks (NCT03571256); the other evaluated flexible doses of deutetrabenazine over 12 weeks (NCT03452943). The studies included a total of 274 pediatric patients who received at least one dose of deutetrabenazine or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline to end-of-treatment on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS). The estimated treatment effect of deutetrabenazine on the YGTSS-TTS was not statistically significantly different from placebo in either study. The placebo subtracted least squares means difference in YGTSS-TTS from baseline to end-of-treatment was -0.7 (95% CI: -4.1, 2.8) in the flexible dose study and -0.8 (95% CI: -3.9, 2.3) for the primary analysis in the fixed dose study. The following adverse reactions were reported in frequencies of at least 5% of pediatric patients treated with AUSTEDO and with a greater incidence than in pediatric patients receiving placebo (AUSTEDO vs placebo): headache (includes: migraine, migraine with aura, and headache; 13% vs 9%), somnolence (includes: sedation, hypersomnia, and somnolence; 11% vs 2%), fatigue (8% vs 3%), increased appetite (5% vs <1%), and increased weight (5% vs <1%). Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Deutetrabenazine orally administered to juvenile rats from postnatal days 21 through 70 (at 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day) resulted in an increased incidence of tremor, hyperactivity, and adverse increases in motor activity at \u22655 mg/kg/day, and reduced body weight and food consumption at 10 mg/kg/day. There was no reproductive or early embryonic toxicity up to the highest dose. All drug-related findings were reversible after a drug-free period. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in juvenile rats was 2.5 mg/kg/day. These drug-related findings were similar to those observed in adult rats; however, the juvenile rats were more sensitive.",
    "geriatric_use": "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of hepatic, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",

    "mechanism_of_action": "12.1 Mechanism of Action Bevacizumab products bind VEGF and prevent the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models of angiogenesis. Administration of bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude (athymic) mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression.",

Advise females of potential risk to fetus and need for use of effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Ovarian Failure : Advise females of the potential risk. ( 5.11 , 8.3 ) Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) : Discontinue MVASI in patients who develop CHF. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforations and Fistulae Serious, and sometimes fatal, gastrointestinal perforation occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from 0.3% to 3% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with a history of prior pelvic radiation. Perforation can be complicated by intra-abdominal abscess, fistula formation, and the need for diverting ostomies. The majority of perforations occurred within 50 days of the first dose [see Adverse Reactions 6.1) ] . Serious fistulae (including, tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, biliary, vaginal, renal and bladder sites) occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from < 1% to 1.8% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with cervical cancer. The majority of fistulae occurred within 6 months of the first dose. Patients who develop a gastrointestinal vaginal fistula may also have a bowel obstruction and require surgical intervention, as well as a diverting ostomy. Avoid MVASI in patients with ovarian cancer who have evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation, tracheoesophageal fistula or any Grade 4 fistula. Discontinue in patients with fistula formation involving any internal organ. 5.2 Surgery and Wound Healing Complications In a controlled clinical study in which bevacizumab was not administered within 28 days of major surgical procedures, the incidence of wound healing complications, including serious and fatal complications, was 15% in patients with mCRC who underwent surgery while receiving bevacizumab and 4% in patients who did not receive bevacizumab. In a controlled clinical study in patients with relapsed or recurrent GBM, the incidence of wound healing events was 5% in patients who received bevacizumab and 0.7% in patients who did not receive bevacizumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In patients who experience wound healing complications during MVASI treatment, withhold MVASI until adequate wound healing. Withhold for at least 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 28 days following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of bevacizumab products after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Necrotizing fasciitis including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab, usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation. Discontinue MVASI in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis. 5.3 Hemorrhage Bevacizumab products can result in two distinct patterns of bleeding: minor hemorrhage, which is most commonly Grade 1 epistaxis, and serious hemorrhage, which in some cases has been fatal. Severe or fatal hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, CNS hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding occurred up to 5-fold more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 hemorrhagic events ranged from 0.4% to 7% in patients receiving bevacizumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 31% of patients with squamous NSCLC and 4% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to none of the patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Do not administer MVASI to patients with recent history of hemoptysis of 1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood. Discontinue in patients who develop a Grade 3-4 hemorrhage. 5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) including cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and angina occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 ATE was 5% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to \u2264 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone; the highest incidence occurred in patients with GBM. The risk of developing ATE was increased in patients with a history of arterial thromboembolism, diabetes, or >65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Discontinue in patients who develop a severe ATE. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products after an ATE is resolved is not known. 5.5 Venous Thromboembolic Events An increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) was observed across clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In Study GOG-0240, Grades 3-4 VTE occurred in 11% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared with 5% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In EORTC 26101, the incidence of Grades 3-4 VTE was 5% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Discontinue MVASI in patients with a Grade 4 VTE, including pulmonary embolism. 5.6 Hypertension Severe hypertension occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies the incidence of Grades 3-4 hypertension ranged from 5% to 18%. Monitor blood pressure every two to three weeks during treatment with MVASI. Treat with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy and monitor blood pressure regularly. Continue to monitor blood pressure at regular intervals in patients with MVASI-induced or -exacerbated hypertension after discontinuing MVASI. Withhold MVASI in patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical management; resume once controlled with medical management. Discontinue in patients who develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 5.7 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES. Discontinue MVASI in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known. 5.8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2-4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2-4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2-4 proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome . In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab. Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during MVASI therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)]. 5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients. Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen). 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Congenital malformations were observed with the administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis every 3 days at a dose as low as a clinical dose of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MVASI and for 6 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 5.11 Ovarian Failure The incidence of ovarian failure was 34% vs. 2% in premenopausal women receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor. After discontinuing bevacizumab, recovery of ovarian function at all time points during the post-treatment period was demonstrated in 22% of women receiving bevacizumab. Recovery of ovarian function is defined as resumption of menses, a positive serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test, or an FSH level < 30 mIU/mL during the post-treatment period. Long-term effects of bevacizumab products on fertility are unknown. Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of ovarian failure prior to initiating MVASI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . 5.12 Congestive Heart Failure MVASI is not indicated for use with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 left ventricular dysfunction was 1% in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Among patients who received prior anthracycline treatment, the rate of congestive heart failure (CHF) was 4% for patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to 0.6% for patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In previously untreated patients with a hematological malignancy, the incidence of CHF and decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were increased in patients receiving bevacizumab with anthracycline-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo with the same chemotherapy regimen. The proportion of patients with a decline in LVEF from baseline of \u2265 20% or a decline from baseline of 10% to < 50%, was 10% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Time to onset of left-ventricular dysfunction or CHF was 1 to 6 months after the first dose in at least 85% of the patients and was resolved in 62% of the patients who developed CHF in the bevacizumab arm compared to 82% in the placebo arm. Discontinue MVASI in patients who develop CHF.",

The safety data in Warnings and Precautions and described below reflect exposure to bevacizumab in 4463 patients including those with mCRC (AVF2107g, E3200), non-squamous NSCLC (E4599), GBM (EORTC 26101), mRCC (BO17705), cervical cancer (GOG-0240), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (MO22224, AVF4095, GOG-0213, and GOG-0218), or another cancer, at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies at a rate > 10% were epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain and exfoliative dermatitis. Across clinical studies, bevacizumab was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Metastatic Colorectal Cancer In Combination with bolus-IFL The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus-IFL in patients with mCRC [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL, bevacizumab with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. All Grades 3\u20134 adverse reactions and selected Grades 1\u20132 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Grades 3-4 Adverse Reactions Occurring at Higher Incidence (\u2265 2%) in Patients Receiving Bevacizumab vs. Placebo in Study AVF2107g Adverse Reaction NCI-CTC version 3. Bevacizumab with IFL (N = 392) Placebo with IFL (N = 396) Hematology Leukopenia 37% 31% Neutropenia 21% 14% Gastrointestinal Diarrhea 34% 25% Abdominal pain 8% 5% Constipation 4% 2% Vascular Hypertension 12% 2% Deep vein thrombosis 9% 5% Intra-abdominal Thrombosis 3% 1% Syncope 3% 1% General Asthenia 10% 7% Pain 8% 5% In Combination with FOLFOX4 The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 521 patients in an open-label, active-controlled study (E3200) in patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for mCRC. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4, bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or bevacizumab alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Selected Grades 3\u20135 non-hematologic and Grades 4\u20135 hematologic occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were fatigue (19% vs. 13%), diarrhea (18% vs. 13%), sensory neuropathy (17% vs. 9%), nausea (12% vs. 5%), vomiting (11% vs. 4%), dehydration (10% vs. 5%), hypertension (9% vs. 2%), abdominal pain (8% vs. 5%), hemorrhage (5% vs. 1%), other neurological (5% vs. 3%), ileus (4% vs. 1%) and headache (3% vs. 0%). These data are likely to under-estimate the true adverse reaction rates due to the reporting mechanisms. First-Line Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated as first-line treatment in 422 patients with unresectable NSCLC who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in an active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (E4599) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non\u2013squamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21-day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Only Grades 3-5 non-hematologic and Grades 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions were collected. Grades 3-5 non-hematologic and Grades 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), fatigue (16% vs. 13%), hypertension (8% vs. 0.7%), infection without neutropenia (7% vs. 3%), venous thromboembolism (5% vs. 3%), febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 2%), pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates (5% vs. 3%), infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), headache (3% vs. 1%) and proteinuria (3% vs. 0%). Recurrent Glioblastoma The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, open-label study (EORTC 26101) in patients with recurrent GBM following radiotherapy and temozolomide of whom 278 patients received at least one dose of bevacizumab and are considered safety evaluable [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. In the bevacizumab with lomustine arm, 22% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10% of patients in the lomustine arm. In patients receiving bevacizumab with lomustine, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 337 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a multicenter, double-blind study (BO17705) in patients with mRCC. Patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to receive either bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo with interferon-alfa [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Grades 3-5 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (> 2%) were fatigue (13% vs. 8%), asthenia (10% vs. 7%), proteinuria (7% vs. 0%), hypertension (6% vs. 1%; including hypertension and hypertensive crisis), and hemorrhage (3% vs. 0.3%; including epistaxis, small intestinal hemorrhage, aneurysm ruptured, gastric ulcer hemorrhage, gingival bleeding, hemoptysis, hemorrhage intracranial, large intestinal hemorrhage, respiratory tract hemorrhage, and traumatic hematoma). Adverse reactions are presented in Table 3.

Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 218 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a multicenter study (GOG-0240) in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks), or paclitaxel and topotecan with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Grades 3\u20134 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in 218 patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 222 patients receiving chemotherapy alone were abdominal pain (12% vs. 10%), hypertension (11% vs. 0.5%), thrombosis (8% vs. 3%), diarrhea (6% vs. 3%), anal fistula (4% vs. 0%), proctalgia (3% vs. 0%), urinary tract infection (8% vs. 6%), cellulitis (3% vs. 0.5%), fatigue (14% vs. 10%), hypokalemia (7% vs. 4%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), dehydration (4% vs. 0.5%), neutropenia (8% vs. 4%), lymphopenia (6% vs. 3%), back pain (6% vs. 3%), and pelvic pain (6% vs. 1%).

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to carboplatin and paclitaxel without bevacizumab (CPP), carboplatin and paclitaxel with bevacizumab for up to six cycles (CPB15), or carboplatin and paclitaxel with bevacizumab for six cycles followed by bevacizumab as a single agent for up to 16 additional doses (CPB15+). Bevacizumab was given at 15 mg/kg every three weeks. On this trial, 1215 patients received at least one dose of bevacizumab. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Grades 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u22652%) in either of the bevacizumab arms versus the control arm were fatigue (CPB15+ - 9%, CPB15 - 6%, CPP - 6%), hypertension (CPB15+ - 10%, CPB15 - 6%, CPP - 2%), thrombocytopenia (CPB15+ - 21%, CPB15 - 20%, CPP - 15%) and leukopenia (CPB15+ - 51%, CPB15 - 53%, CPP - 50%).

Patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received bevacizumab alone upon progression. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Grades 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence ( \u2265 2%) in 179 patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 181 patients receiving chemotherapy alone were hypertension (6.7% vs. 1.1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (4.5% vs. 1.7%).

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other bevacizumab products may be misleading. In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor, 0.6% (14/2233) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bevacizumab antibodies as detected by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. Among these 14 patients, three tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical significance of these anti-bevacizumab antibodies is not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bevacizumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General: Polyserositis Cardiovascular: Pulmonary hypertension, Mesenteric venous occlusion Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal ulcer, Intestinal necrosis, Anastomotic ulceration Hemic and lymphatic: Pancytopenia Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder perforation Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Osteonecrosis of the jaw Renal: Renal thrombotic microangiopathy (manifested as severe proteinuria) Respiratory: Nasal septum perforation Vascular: Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture",

    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and their mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm in pregnant women. Limited postmarketing reports describe cases of fetal malformations with use of bevacizumab products in pregnancy; however, these reports are insufficient to determine drug associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits every 3 days during organogenesis at doses approximately 1 to 10 times the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg produced fetal resorptions, decreased maternal and fetal weight gain and multiple congenital malformations including corneal opacities and abnormal ossification of the skull and skeleton including limb and phalangeal defects (see Data ) . Furthermore, animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryofetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Pregnant rabbits dosed with 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg bevacizumab (approximately 1 to 10 times the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg) every three days during the period of organogenesis (gestation day 6-18) exhibited decreases in maternal and fetal body weights and increased number of fetal resorptions. There were dose-related increases in the number of litters containing fetuses with any type of malformation (42% for the 0 mg/kg dose, 76% for the 30 mg/kg dose, and 95% for the 100 mg/kg dose) or fetal alterations (9% for the 0 mg/kg dose, 15% for the 30 mg/kg dose, and 61% for the 100 mg/kg dose). Skeletal deformities were observed at all dose levels, with some abnormalities including meningocele observed only at the 100 mg/kg dose level. Teratogenic effects included: reduced or irregular ossification in the skull, jaw, spine, ribs, tibia and bones of the paws; fontanel, rib and hindlimb deformities; corneal opacity; and absent hindlimb phalanges.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab products in pediatric patients have not been established. In published literature reports, cases of non-mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of 18 years who received bevacizumab. Bevacizumab products are not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years. Antitumor activity was not observed among eight pediatric patients with relapsed GBM who received bevacizumab and irinotecan. Addition of bevacizumab to standard of care did not result in improved event-free survival in pediatric patients enrolled in two randomized clinical studies, one in high grade glioma (n = 121) and one in metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (n = 154). Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data from 152 pediatric and young adult patients with cancer (7 months to 21 years of age), bevacizumab clearance normalized by body weight in pediatrics was comparable to that in adults. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile cynomolgus monkeys with open growth plates exhibited physeal dysplasia following 4 to 26 weeks exposure at 0.4 to 20 times the recommended human dose (based on mg/kg and exposure).

( 2.3 ) \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for complete preparation and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Administration Information BENLYSTA may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Vials are intended for intravenous use only (not for subcutaneous use) and autoinjectors and prefilled syringes are intended for subcutaneous use only (not for intravenous use). 2.2 Recommended Intravenous Dosage for Adult and Pediatric Patients with SLE or Lupus Nephritis Dosage BENLYSTA for intravenous use must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The recommended intravenous dosage is 10 mg/kg at 2\u2011week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4\u2011week intervals thereafter. Reconstitute, dilute, and administer as an intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. The infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Precautions Prior to Intravenous Use BENLYSTA should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Prior to intravenous dosing with BENLYSTA, consider administering premedication for prophylaxis against infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Preparation of Intravenous Solutions BENLYSTA for intravenous use is provided as a lyophilized powder in a single\u2011dose vial and should be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique as follows. Use of a 21- to 25-gauge needle is recommended when piercing the vial stopper for reconstitution and dilution. Reconstitution Instructions for Intravenous Use: 1. Remove the vial of BENLYSTA from the refrigerator and allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes for the vial to reach room temperature. 2. Reconstitute the BENLYSTA powder with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as follows. The reconstituted solution will contain a concentration of 80 mg/mL belimumab. 3. Reconstitute the 120-mg vial with 1.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 4. Reconstitute the 400-mg vial with 4.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 5. The stream of sterile water should be directed toward the side of the vial to minimize foaming. Gently swirl the vial for 60 seconds. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 60 seconds every 5 minutes until the powder is dissolved. Do not shake. Reconstitution is typically complete within 10 to 15 minutes after the sterile water has been added, but it may take up to 30 minutes. Protect the reconstituted solution from sunlight. 6. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute BENLYSTA, it should not exceed 500 rpm and the vial swirled for no longer than 30 minutes. 7. Once reconstitution is complete, the solution should be opalescent and colorless to pale yellow, and without particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable. Dilution Instructions for Intravenous Use: 1. Dextrose intravenous solutions are incompatible with BENLYSTA. BENLYSTA should only be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (half-normal saline), or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP to a volume of 250 mL for intravenous infusion. To prepare the intravenous infusion solution for patients whose body weight is less than or equal to 40 kg, a 100 mL bag or bottle of normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection may be used such that the resulting belimumab concentration in the infusion bag does not exceed 4 mg/mL. From a 250\u2011mL (or 100\u2011mL) infusion bag or bottle of normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, withdraw and discard a volume equal to the volume of the reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA required for the patient\u2019s dose. Then add the required volume of the reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA into the intravenous infusion solution in the infusion bag or bottle. Gently invert the bag or bottle to mix the intravenous infusion solution. Any unused solution in the vials must be discarded. 2. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discoloration is observed. 3. The reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA, if not used immediately, should be stored protected from direct sunlight and refrigerated at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Solutions of BENLYSTA diluted in normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection may be stored at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) or room temperature. The total time from reconstitution of BENLYSTA to completion of infusion should not exceed 8 hours. 4. No incompatibilities between BENLYSTA and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin bags have been observed. Administration Instructions for Intravenous Use 1. The diluted solution of BENLYSTA should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. 2. BENLYSTA should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the coadministration of BENLYSTA with other agents. 2.3 Recommended Subcutaneous Dosage The recommended dosages of BENLYSTA, when administered subcutaneously, are provided in Table 1 . When administered subcutaneously, BENLYSTA should be administered in the patient\u2019s abdomen or thigh. For patients less than 10 years of age, BENLYSTA must be administered by a healthcare professional or trained caregiver. Table 1. Recommended Subcutaneous Dosage of BENLYSTA a Autoinjector only . NOTE: The prefilled syringe has not been studied in children less than 18 years of age. b The 400-mg dose is recommended for adult patients initiating therapy with BENLYSTA for active lupus nephritis and requires administration of 2 autoinjectors or 2 prefilled syringes. Adults (Autoinjector or Prefilled Syringe) Pediatric Patients (5 to less than 18 Years of Age) a (Autoinjector) SLE 200 mg once weekly Patients \u226540 kg: 200 mg once weekly Patients 15 kg to <40 kg: 200 mg once every 2 weeks Lupus Nephritis 400 mg b once weekly x 4 doses, followed by 200 mg once weekly Safety and efficacy of subcutaneous administration have not been established Transitioning from Intravenous to Subcutaneous Administration SLE: Administer the first subcutaneous dose 1 to 4 weeks after the last intravenous dose. Lupus Nephritis : A patient with lupus nephritis may transition from intravenous therapy with BENLYSTA to subcutaneous therapy after the patient completes the first 2 intravenous doses. If transitioning, administer the first subcutaneous dose of 200 mg 1 to 2 weeks after the last intravenous dose. Administration Instructions for Subcutaneous Injection 1. It is recommended that the first subcutaneous injection of BENLYSTA should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The healthcare provider should provide proper training in subcutaneous technique and education about signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A patient may self-inject or the patient caregiver may administer BENLYSTA subcutaneously after the healthcare provider determines it is appropriate. 2. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to follow the directions for administration provided in the Instructions for Use. 3. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to remove the autoinjector or prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to the subcutaneous injection. Do not warm BENLYSTA in any other way. 4. Prior to administration, instruct the patient or patient caregiver to visually inspect the window of the autoinjector or the prefilled syringe for particulate matter or discoloration. BENLYSTA should be clear to opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Do not use BENLYSTA if the product exhibits discoloration or particulate matter. Instruct the patient not to use the BENLYSTA autoinjector or prefilled syringe if dropped on a hard surface. 5. When injecting in the same body region, advise the patient or patient caregiver to use a different injection site for each injection; never give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. When a 400-mg dose is administered at the same site, it is recommended that the 2 individual 200-mg injections be administered at least 5 cm (approximately 2 inches) apart. 6. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to administer BENLYSTA, preferably on the same day each week or the same day of alternate weeks, as appropriate. 7. If a dose is missed, instruct the patient to administer a dose as soon as the patient remembers. Thereafter, the patient can resume dosing on their usual day of administration or start a new schedule from the day that the missed dose was administered.",
    "mechanism_of_action": "12.1 Mechanism of Action BENLYSTA is a BLyS-specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to its receptors on B cells. BENLYSTA does not bind B cells directly, but by binding BLyS, BENLYSTA inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.",

    "warnings_and_cautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious Infections: Serious and sometimes fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including BENLYSTA. Use with caution in patients with severe or chronic infections. Consider interrupting therapy with BENLYSTA if patients develop a new infection during treatment with BENLYSTA. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): Evaluate patients with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms for PML. If PML is suspected, immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA, must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA, must be discontinued. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis: Serious and fatal reactions have been reported. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Depression and Suicidality: Depression and suicidality were reported in trials with BENLYSTA. Assess for depression and risk of suicide before treatment with BENLYSTA and monitor during treatment. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, or other mood changes occur. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Immunization: Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with BENLYSTA. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including BENLYSTA. Overall, the incidence of serious infections in controlled trials was similar in patients receiving BENLYSTA compared with placebo, whereas fatal infections occurred more frequently in patients receiving BENLYSTA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Consider the risk and benefit before initiating treatment with BENLYSTA in patients with severe or chronic infections. Consider interrupting therapy with BENLYSTA in patients who develop a new infection while receiving it and monitor these patients closely. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Cases of JC virus-associated PML resulting in neurological deficits, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients with SLE receiving immunosuppressants, including BENLYSTA. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms and consult with a neurologist or other appropriate specialist as clinically indicated. In patients with suspected PML, immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA, must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA, must be discontinued. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death, and infusion-related reactions have been reported in association with BENLYSTA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . These events generally occurred within hours of the infusion; however, they may occur later. Non-acute hypersensitivity reactions including rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and facial edema have been reported and typically occurred up to a week following the most recent infusion. Hypersensitivity, including serious reactions, has occurred in patients who have previously tolerated infusions of BENLYSTA. Limited data suggest that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant hypersensitivity may be at increased risk. Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related reactions in all cases. In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE, some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked a hypersensitivity response or infusion-related reaction; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of hypersensitivity reactions or infusion-related reaction. BENLYSTA for intravenous use should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which may present as infusion-related reactions. In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue BENLYSTA immediately and administer appropriate medical therapy. With intravenous administration, the infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. Monitor patients during infusion and for an appropriate period of time after intravenous administration of BENLYSTA. Consider administering premedication as prophylaxis prior to intravenous dosing [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Inform patients receiving BENLYSTA of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should a reaction occur. 5.3 Depression and Suicidality In controlled clinical trials, depression and suicidality were reported in patients receiving BENLYSTA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Assess the risk of depression and suicide considering the patient\u2019s medical history and current psychiatric status before treatment with BENLYSTA and continue to monitor patients during treatment. Instruct patients receiving BENLYSTA (and caregivers, if applicable) to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or other mood changes. Consider the risk and benefit of continued treatment with BENLYSTA for patients who develop such symptoms. 5.4 Malignancy There is an increased risk of malignancies with the use of immunosuppressants. The impact of treatment with BENLYSTA on the development of malignancies is not known [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Consider the individual benefit-risk in patients with known risk factors for the development or reoccurrence of malignancy prior to prescribing BENLYSTA. In patients who develop malignancies, consider the risk and benefit of continued treatment with BENLYSTA. 5.5 Immunization Because of its mechanism of action, BENLYSTA may interfere with the response to immunizations. Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with BENLYSTA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving BENLYSTA or the effect of BENLYSTA on new immunizations. 5.6 Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies Available data do not support the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of BENLYSTA with rituximab in patients with SLE. An increased incidence of serious infections and post-injection systemic reactions in patients receiving BENLYSTA concomitantly with rituximab compared to patients receiving BENLYSTA alone has been observed [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and efficacy of BENLYSTA concomitantly with other biologic therapies, including B-cell-targeted therapies, have not been established.

Clinical Trials with Intravenous Administration Adult Patients with SLE: The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in 2,133 adult patients with SLE in 3 controlled trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3). Patients received BENLYSTA plus standard therapy at doses of 1 mg/kg (n = 673), 4 mg/kg (n = 111; Trial 1 only), or 10 mg/kg (n = 674), or placebo plus standard therapy (n = 675) intravenously over a 1\u2011hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days. In 2 of the trials (Trial 1 and Trial 3), treatment was given for 48 weeks, while in the other trial (Trial 2) treatment was given for 72 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Because there was no apparent dose-related increase in the majority of adverse events observed with BENLYSTA, the safety data summarized below are presented for the 3 intravenous doses pooled, unless otherwise indicated; the adverse reaction table displays the results for the recommended intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg compared with placebo. In these trials, 93% of patients treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy reported an adverse event compared with 92% treated with placebo plus standard therapy. The most common serious adverse events were serious infections (6% and 5.2% in the groups receiving BENLYSTA and placebo plus standard therapy, respectively), some of which were fatal. The most commonly reported adverse events, occurring in \u22655% of patients in clinical trials were nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity, depression, migraine, and pharyngitis. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trials was 6.2% for patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 7.1% for patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of treatment (\u22651% of patients receiving BENLYSTA or placebo) were infusion reactions (1.6% BENLYSTA and 0.9% placebo), lupus nephritis (0.7% BENLYSTA and 1.2% placebo), and infections (0.7% BENLYSTA and 1% placebo). Table 2 lists adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in at least 3% of patients with SLE who received BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy and at an incidence at least 1% greater than that observed with placebo plus standard therapy in 3 controlled trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3). Table 2.

The most frequent infections (>5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and influenza. Infections leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 1.0% of patients receiving placebo. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 104-week trial of active lupus nephritis in adults receiving BENLYSTA administered intravenously (N = 448), the overall incidence of infections was 82% in patients receiving BENLYSTA compared with 76% in patients receiving placebo. Serious Infections: In controlled trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE, the incidence of serious infections was 6.0% in patients receiving BENLYSTA and 5.2% in patients receiving placebo. The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cellulitis, and bronchitis. Fatal infections occurred in 0.3% (4/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 104-week trial of active lupus nephritis in adults receiving BENLYSTA administered intravenously, serious infections occurred in 14% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in 17% of patients receiving placebo. Fatal infections occurred in 0.9% (2/224) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in 0.9% (2/224) of patients receiving placebo. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, postmarketing safety trial of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE (N = 4,003), the incidence of serious infections was 3.7% in patients receiving BENLYSTA compared with 4.1% in patients receiving placebo. Serious infections leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 1.0% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in 0.9% of patients receiving placebo. Fatal infections occurred in 0.45% (9/2,002) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in 0.15% (3/2,001) of patients receiving placebo, where the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.50% (10/2,002) in patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.40% (8/2,001) in patients receiving placebo. Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis: In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE, hypersensitivity reactions (occurring on the same day of infusion) were reported in 13% (191/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 11% (76/675) of patients receiving placebo. Anaphylaxis was observed in 0.6% (9/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% (3/675) of patients receiving placebo. Manifestations included hypotension, angioedema, urticaria or other rash, pruritus, and dyspnea. Infusion-Related Reactions: In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE, adverse events associated with the infusion (occurring on the same day of the infusion) were reported in 17% (251/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 15% (99/675) of patients receiving placebo. Serious infusion reactions (excluding hypersensitivity reactions) were reported in 0.5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and included bradycardia, myalgia, headache, rash, urticaria, and hypotension. The most common infusion reactions (\u22653% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were headache, nausea, and skin reactions. Depression and Suicidality: In controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE (N = 2,133), psychiatric events were reported more frequently with BENLYSTA (16%) than with placebo (12%), primarily related to depression-related events (6.3% BENLYSTA; 4.7% placebo), insomnia (6% BENLYSTA; 5.3% placebo), and anxiety (3.9% BENLYSTA; 2.8% placebo). Serious psychiatric events were reported in 0.8% (12/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% (3/675) of patients receiving placebo. Serious depression was reported in 0.4% (6/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo. Two suicides (0.1%) were reported in patients receiving BENLYSTA (one with 10 mg/kg and one with 1 mg/kg). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, postmarketing safety trial of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE (N = 4,003), serious psychiatric events were reported in 1% (20/2,002) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.3% (6/2,001) of patients receiving placebo. Serious depression was reported in 0.3% (7/2,002) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in <0.1% (1/2,001) receiving placebo. The overall incidence of serious suicidal ideation or behavior or self-injury without suicidal intent was 0.7% (15/2,002) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.2% (5/2,001) of patients receiving placebo. On the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), 2.4% (48/1,974) of patients receiving BENLYSTA reported suicidal ideation or behavior compared with 2% (39/1,988) of patients receiving placebo. No suicide was reported in either group. The intravenous trials above did not exclude patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. Malignancy: In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously in adults with SLE, malignancies (including non-melanoma skin cancers) were reported in 0.4% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. In the intravenous controlled clinical trials, malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, were observed in 0.2% (3/1,458) and 0.3% (2/675) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and placebo, respectively. Black/African-American Patients: The safety of BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg administered intravenously in adults plus standard therapy (n = 331) compared with placebo plus standard therapy (n = 165) in Black patients with SLE (Trial 4) was consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy in the overall population [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Adult Patients with Lupus Nephritis: The safety of BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg administered intravenously plus standard therapy (n = 224) compared with placebo plus standard therapy (n = 224) was evaluated in adults with active lupus nephritis for up to 104 weeks (Trial 5) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The adverse reactions observed were consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy in patients with SLE. Cases of myelosuppression, including febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia, were observed in subjects who received induction therapy with cyclophosphamide followed by maintenance therapy with azathioprine, or mycophenolate. Pediatric Patients: The safety of BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy (n = 53) compared with placebo plus standard therapy (n = 40) was evaluated in 93 pediatric patients with SLE (Trial 6). The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in adults with SLE [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Clinical Trials with Subcutaneous Administration The data described below reflect exposure to BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in 836 adult patients with SLE in a controlled trial (Trial 7). In addition to standard therapy, patients received BENLYSTA 200 mg (n = 556) or placebo (n = 280) (2:1 randomization) once weekly for up to 52 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . In the trial, 81% of patients treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy reported an adverse event compared with 84% treated with placebo plus standard therapy. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trial was 7.2% of patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 8.9% of patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. The safety profile observed for BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously plus standard therapy was consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy, with the exception of local injection site reactions. Infections: In a controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously in adults with SLE (N = 836), the overall incidence of infections was 55% in patients receiving BENLYSTA compared with 57% in patients receiving placebo. The most commonly reported infections with BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously were similar to those reported with BENLYSTA administered intravenously. Serious Infections: In a controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously in adults with SLE (N = 836), the incidence of serious infections was 4.1% in patients receiving BENLYSTA and 5.4% in patients receiving placebo. Fatal infections occurred in 0.5% (3/556) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in none of the patients receiving placebo (0/280). Depression and Suicidality: In a controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously in adults with SLE (N = 836), which excluded patients with a history of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric events were reported in 6% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 11% of patients receiving placebo. Depression-related events were reported in 2.7% (15/556) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 3.6% (10/280) of patients receiving placebo. Serious psychiatric events were reported in 0.2% (1/556) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in no patients receiving placebo. There were no serious depression-related events or suicides reported in either group. On the C\u2011SSRS, 1.3% (7/554) of patients receiving BENLYSTA reported suicidal ideation or behavior compared with 0.7% (2/277) of patients receiving placebo. Malignancy: In a controlled clinical trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously in adults with SLE (N = 836), the reports of malignancies were similar to those reported with BENLYSTA administered intravenously. Injection Site Reactions: In a controlled clinical trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously in adults with SLE (N = 836), the frequency of injection site reactions was 6.1% (34/556) for patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 2.5% (7/280) for patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. These injection site reactions (most commonly pain, erythema, hematoma, pruritus, and induration) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority (94%) did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Concomitant Use of Rituximab in Adults: BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously in combination with rituximab was studied in a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo\u2011controlled, 104-week study in adult patients with SLE. Patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment arms: BENLYSTA with a single cycle of rituximab (n = 144); BENLYSTA with placebo (n = 72); BENLYSTA plus standard therapy (n = 76). In general, adverse reactions were consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA and rituximab. When compared with BENLYSTA and placebo or BENLYSTA plus standard therapy, BENLYSTA in combination with rituximab was associated with higher frequency of serious adverse events (13.9%, 19.7%, 22.2%), serious infections (2.8%, 5.3%, 9.0%), and post-injection systemic reactions (9.7%, 5.3%, 13.2%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BENLYSTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Fatal anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )].",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with BENLYSTA. In clinical trials, BENLYSTA was administered concomitantly with other drugs, including corticosteroids, antimalarials, immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents (including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and mycophenolate), angiotensin pathway antihypertensives, HMG\u2011CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without evidence of a clinically meaningful effect of these concomitant medications on belimumab pharmacokinetics. The effect of belimumab on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs has not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS BENLYSTA is contraindicated in patients who have had anaphylaxis with belimumab. Previous anaphylaxis to belimumab. ( 4 )",
    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that evaluates pregnancy outcomes in women with lupus exposed to BENLYSTA during pregnancy. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to refer patients and pregnant women are encouraged to enroll themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/benlysta-belimumab/ . Risk Summary Available data on use of BENLYSTA in pregnant women, from observational studies, published case reports, and postmarketing surveillance, are insufficient to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with SLE (see Clinical Considerations ) . Monoclonal antibodies, such as belimumab, are actively transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero-exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . In an animal combined embryo-fetal and pre- and post-natal development study with monkeys that received belimumab by intravenous administration, there was no evidence of fetal harm with exposures approximately 9 times (based on intravenous administration) and 20 times (based on subcutaneous administration) the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Belimumab-related findings in monkey fetuses and/or infants included reductions of B-cell counts, reductions in the density of lymphoid tissue B-lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes, and altered IgG and IgM titers. The no-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was not identified for these findings; however, they were reversible within 3 to 12 months after the drug was discontinued (see Data ) . Based on animal data and the mechanism of action of belimumab, the immune system in infants of treated mothers may be adversely affected. It is unknown, based on available data, whether immune effects, if identified, are reversible [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with SLE are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including worsening of the underlying disease, premature birth, miscarriage, and intrauterine growth restriction. Maternal lupus nephritis increases the risk of hypertension and preeclampsia/eclampsia. Passage of maternal autoantibodies across the placenta may result in adverse neonatal outcomes, including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to BENLYSTA in utero. Monitor an infant of a treated mother for B-cell reduction and other immune dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Data Animal Data: In a combined embryo-fetal and pre- and post-natal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received belimumab at intravenous doses of 0, 5, or 150 mg/kg every 2 weeks from confirmation of pregnancy at Gestation Days (GD) 20 to 22, throughout the period of organogenesis (up to approximately GD 50), and continuing to either the day of scheduled cesarean section (GD 150 [late third trimester]) or the day of parturition. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity, effects on embryofetal and infant survival, or structural abnormalities at exposure approximately 9 times the MRHD of 10 mg/kg intravenously or 20 times the MRHD of 200 mg subcutaneously (on an area under the curve [AUC] basis with maternal animal intravenous doses up to 150 mg/kg). Belimumab-related findings in mothers included reductions of immature and mature B-cell counts and in fetuses and/or infants included reductions of immature and mature B-cell counts, reductions in the density of lymphoid tissue B-lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes, reduced spleen weights, increased IgG titers, and reduced IgM titers. B-cell counts in infant monkeys exposed to belimumab in utero recovered by 3 months of age and in mothers after 1 year. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM levels in infant monkeys recovered by 6 months of age and the reductions in B-lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen were reversed by 1 year of age. Belimumab crossed the placenta, as it was detected in fetal cord blood and amniotic fluid on GD 150.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of BENLYSTA have been established for the treatment of SLE and lupus nephritis in pediatric patients 5 to less than 18 years of age. Intravenous Use Use of BENLYSTA intravenously in pediatric patients with SLE is supported by evidence from pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy results from a pediatric study (Trial 6), as well as PK exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of BENYLSTA plus standard therapy from the Phase 3 intravenous studies in adults with SLE. A randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, PK, efficacy, and safety study (Trial 6) to evaluate intravenously administered BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy over 52 weeks was conducted in 93 pediatric patients with SLE. The proportion of pediatric patients achieving an SRI-4 response was higher in patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. Pediatric patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy also had a lower risk of experiencing a severe flare compared with placebo plus standard therapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a total of 53 pediatric patients with SLE and were consistent with the adult population with SLE [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Use of intravenous administration of BENLYSTA in pediatric patients with active lupus nephritis is based on the extrapolation of efficacy from the intravenous study in adults (n = 224) with active lupus nephritis, and supported by pharmacokinetic data from intravenous studies in adults (n = 224) with active lupus nephritis and from pediatric patients (n = 53) with SLE. Estimated belimumab exposures for pediatric patients were comparable to adults with active lupus nephritis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Subcutaneous Use Use of BENLYSTA, administered subcutaneously in pediatric patients (5 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) with SLE, is supported by evidence from an open-label pharmacokinetic trial (subcutaneous administration of BENLYSTA in pediatric patients with SLE) and Trial 6 (a pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety study of intravenous dosing in pediatric patients with SLE). The pharmacokinetics of belimumab, following subcutaneous administration in pediatric patients, are estimated to be similar to adults who receive BENLYSTA subcutaneously and pediatric patients who receive BENLYSTA intravenously [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety and effectiveness of the subcutaneous administration of BENLYSTA, in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with active lupus nephritis, have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of BENLYSTA have not been established in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age.",

Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue BIKTARVY. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY. Closely monitor hepatic function in these patients. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ( 5.1 )",
    "warnings_and_cautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ( 5.3 ) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein when initiating BIKTARVY and during therapy as clinically appropriate in all patients. Also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. ( 5.4 ) Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV Patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before or when initiating antiretroviral therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing FTC and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue BIKTARVY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. 5.2 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of BIKTARVY with certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4) , and Drug Interactions (7.5) ]: Loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 3 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during BIKTARVY therapy; review concomitant medications during BIKTARVY therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome, have been reported with TAF-containing products; while most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events, it is also possible these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir-related adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ]. BIKTARVY is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 15 to below 30 mL/min), or patients with ESRD (estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min) who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis, or patients with no antiretroviral treatment history and ESRD who are receiving chronic hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions. Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY, and during treatment with BIKTARVY, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue BIKTARVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. 5.5 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including emtricitabine, a component of BIKTARVY, and tenofovir DF, another prodrug of tenofovir, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with BIKTARVY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).",

    "information_for_patients": "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Post-treatment Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients with HBV Coinfection Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing FTC and/or TDF, and may likewise occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Advise the patient to not discontinue BIKTARVY without first informing their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions BIKTARVY may interact with certain drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or non-prescription medication or herbal products including St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Renal Impairment Advise patients to avoid taking BIKTARVY with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic agents. Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with use of drugs similar to BIKTARVY. Advise patients that they should stop BIKTARVY if they develop clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Missed Dosage Inform patients that it is important to take BIKTARVY on a regular dosing schedule with or without food and to avoid missing doses as it can result in development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Tablet Splitting Advise caregivers that, for children unable to swallow a whole tablet, the tablet can be split and each part taken separately as long as all parts are ingested within approximately 10 minutes [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Pregnancy Registry Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to BIKTARVY [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Lactation Inform individuals with HIV-1 infection that the potential risks of breastfeeding include: (1) HIV-1 transmission to HIV-1\u2013negative infants, (2) developing viral resistance in HIV-1\u2013positive infants, and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ].",

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5%, all grades) are diarrhea, nausea, and headache.

Clinical Trials in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The primary safety assessment of BIKTARVY was based on data from two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Trial 1489 and Trial 1490, that enrolled 1274 HIV-1 infected adult subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history through Week 144. After Week 144, subjects received open-label BIKTARVY in an optional extension phase for an additional 96 weeks (end of study). A total of 634 and 1025 subjects received one tablet of BIKTARVY once daily during the double-blind (Week 144) and extension phases, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The most common adverse reactions (all Grades) reported in at least 5% of subjects in the BIKTARVY group in either Trial 1489 or Trial 1490 were diarrhea, nausea, and headache. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment through Week 144 with BIKTARVY, abacavir [ABC]/dolutegravir [DTG]/ lamivudine [3TC]), or DTG + FTC/TAF, due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 1%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 2% in the BIKTARVY group. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all adverse events attributed to trial drugs by the investigator. No adverse reactions of Grade 2 or higher occurred in > 1% of subjects treated with BIKTARVY. (All Grades) Reported in \u2265 2% of HIV-1 Infected Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History Receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 or 1490 (Week 144 analysis) Trial 1489 Trial 1490 Adverse Reactions BIKTARVY N=314 ABC/DTG/3TC N=315 BIKTARVY N=320 DTG + FTC/TAF N=325 Diarrhea 6% 4% 3% 3% Nausea 6% 18% 3% 5% Headache 5% 5% 4% 3% Fatigue 3% 4% 2% 2% Abnormal dreams 3% 3% <1% 1% Dizziness 2% 3% 2% 1% Insomnia 2% 3% 2% <1% Abdominal distention 2% 2% 1% 2% Additional adverse reactions (all Grades) occurring in less than 2% of subjects administered BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 included vomiting, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, rash, and depression. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and depression suicidal occurred in 2% of subjects administered BIKTARVY; these events occurred primarily in subjects with a preexisting history of depression, prior suicide attempt or psychiatric illness. The majority (84%) of adverse events associated with BIKTARVY were Grade 1. Adverse reactions in the open-label extension phases of Trials 1489 and 1490 were similar to those observed in subjects administered BIKTARVY in the Week 144 analysis. Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults The safety of BIKTARVY in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 282 subjects in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (Trial 1844) in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from either DTG + ABC/3TC or ABC/DTG/3TC to BIKTARVY; Week 48 data from 290 subjects in an open-label, active-controlled trial in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from a regimen containing atazanavir (ATV) (given with cobicistat or ritonavir) or darunavir (DRV) (given with cobicistat or ritonavir) plus either FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC, to BIKTARVY (Trial 1878); and Week 48 data from a randomized, double-blind active-controlled trial in which 284 virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from DTG plus either FTC/TAF or FTC/TDF, to BIKTARVY (Trial 4030). Overall, the safety profile in virologically-suppressed adult subjects in Trials 1844, 1878, and 4030 was similar to that in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Clinical Trial in Adults with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis The safety of FTC and TAF (components of BIKTARVY) was evaluated in a single arm, open-label trial (Trial 1825) in virologically-suppressed adults with ESRD (estimated creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL/min) on chronic hemodialysis treated with FTC+TAF in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet for 96 weeks (N=55). The most commonly reported adverse reaction (adverse event assessed as causally related by investigator and all grades) was nausea (7%). Serious adverse events were reported in 65% of subjects and the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (15%), fluid overload (7%), hyperkalemia (11%) and osteomyelitis (7%). Overall 7% of subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. In an extension phase of Trial 1825 in which 10 subjects switched to BIKTARVY for 48 weeks, the safety findings were similar to those in the initial phase of the open-label trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3\u20134) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 are presented in Table 2. Table 2 Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3\u20134) Reported in \u2265 2% of Subjects Receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 or 1490 (Week 144 analysis) Trial 1489 Trial 1490 Laboratory Parameter Abnormality Frequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities.

Increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 4 of treatment and remained stable through Week 144. In Trials 1489 and 1490, median (Q1, Q3) serum creatinine increased by 0.11 (0.03, 0.19) mg per dL from baseline to Week 144 in the BIKTARVY group and was similar to the comparator groups who received ABC/DTG/3TC, or DTG + FTC/TAF. There were no discontinuations due to renal adverse events and renal serious adverse events were encountered in less than 1% of participants treated with BIKTARVY through Week 144 in clinical trials. Changes in Bilirubin: In Trials 1489 and 1490, total bilirubin increases were observed in 17% of subjects administered BIKTARVY through Week 144. Increases were primarily Grade 1 (1.0 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN) (12%) and Grade 2 (1.5 to 2.5 \u00d7 ULN) (4%). Graded bilirubin increases in the ABC/DTG/3TC, and DTG + FTC/TAF groups, were 7% and 8%, respectively. Increases were primarily Grade 1 (5% ABC/DTG/3TC and 7% DTG + FTC/TAF) or Grade 2 (2% ABC/DTG/3TC and 2% DTG + FTC/TAF). There were no discontinuations due to hepatic adverse events through Week 144 in BIKTARVY clinical studies. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects The safety of BIKTARVY was evaluated in HIV-1 infected virologically-suppressed subjects between the ages of 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 35 kg (N=50) through Week 48 (cohort 1), in virologically-suppressed subjects between the ages of 6 to less than 12 years and weighing at least 25 kg (N=50) through Week 24 (cohort 2), and in virologically suppressed subjects at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg (N=22) through Week 24 (cohort 3) in an open label clinical trial (Trial 1474) [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . No new adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities were identified compared to those observed in adults. Adverse reactions were reported in 11% of pediatric subjects. The majority (76%) of adverse reactions were Grade 1. No Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were reported. The adverse reaction reported by more than one subject (regardless of severity) was abdominal discomfort (n=2). One subject (1%) had Grade 2 adverse reactions of insomnia and anxiety that led to discontinuation of BIKTARVY. The other adverse reactions that occurred in single subjects were similar to those seen in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during post approval use of BIKTARVY or products containing TAF. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Renal and Urinary Disorders Acute renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal renal tubulopathy, and Fanconi syndrome Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and urticaria Investigations Weight increased",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Because BIKTARVY is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended. ( 7.1 ) Consult the Full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for important drug interactions. ( 4 , 5.2 , 7 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Other Antiretroviral Medications Because BIKTARVY is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Comprehensive information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided because the safety and efficacy of concomitant HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy is unknown. 7.2 Potential for BIKTARVY to Affect Other Drugs BIC inhibits organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) in vitro . Coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that are substrates of OCT2 and MATE1 (e.g., dofetilide) may increase their plasma concentrations (see Table 3 ). 7.3 Potential Effect of Other Drugs on One or More Components of BIKTARVY BIC is a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1. A drug that is a strong inducer of CYP3A and also an inducer of UGT1A1 can substantially decrease the plasma concentrations of BIC which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and development of resistance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The use of BIKTARVY with a drug that is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and also an inhibitor of UGT1A1 may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of BIC. TAF is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of drugs that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and plasma concentrations of TAF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TAF, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and development of resistance (see Table 3 ). 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because FTC and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.5 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 3 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions with recommended prevention or management strategies. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either BIKTARVY, the components of BIKTARVY (BIC, FTC, and TAF) as individual agents, or are drug interactions that may occur with BIKTARVY [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 3 Established and Potentially Significant Table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Regimen May be Recommended Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration \u2191 = Increase, \u2193 = Decrease. Clinical Comment Antiarrhythmics: dofetilide \u2191 Dofetilide Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening events associated with dofetilide therapy [see Contraindications (4) ] . Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine Drug-drug interaction study was conducted with either BIKTARVY or its components as individual agents. oxcarbazepine phenobarbital phenytoin \u2193 BIC \u2193 TAF Coadministration with alternative anticonvulsants should be considered. Antimycobacterials: rifabutin rifampin , Strong inducer of CYP3Aand P-gp, and inducer of UGT1A1. rifapentine \u2193 BIC \u2193 TAF Coadministration with rifampin is contraindicated due to the effect of rifampin on the BIC component of BIKTARVY [see Contraindications (4) ] . Coadministration with rifabutin or rifapentine is not recommended. Herbal Products: St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. \u2193 BIC \u2193 TAF Coadministration with St. John's wort is not recommended. Medications or oral supplements containing polyvalent cations (e.g., Mg, Al, Ca, Fe): Calcium or iron supplements Cation-containing antacids or laxatives Sucralfate Buffered medications \u2193 BIC Antacids containing Al/Mg: BIKTARVY can be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking antacids containing Al/Mg. Routine administration of BIKTARVY together with, or 2 hours after, antacids containing Al/Mg is not recommended. Supplements or Antacids containing Calcium or Iron: BIKTARVY and supplements or antacids containing calcium or iron can be taken together with food. Routine administration of BIKTARVY under fasting conditions together with, or 2 hours after, supplements or antacids containing calcium or iron is not recommended. Metformin \u2191 Metformin Refer to the prescribing information of metformin for assessing the benefit and risk of concomitant use of BIKTARVY and metformin. 7.6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with BIKTARVY Based on drug interaction studies conducted with BIKTARVY or the components of BIKTARVY, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed when BIKTARVY is combined with the following drugs: ethinyl estradiol, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, midazolam, norgestimate, sertraline, sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.",

    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to BIKTARVY during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Risk Summary There are insufficient human data on the use of BIKTARVY during pregnancy to inform a drug-associated risk of birth defects and miscarriage. Dolutegravir, another integrase inhibitor, has been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) (see Data ) . Discuss the benefit-risk of using BIKTARVY with individuals of childbearing potential, particularly if pregnancy is being planned. BIKTARVY use during pregnancy has been evaluated in a limited number of women reported to the APR; consequently, there are insufficient BIC data from the APR to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects. Reports of pregnant individuals treated with other drug products containing TAF or FTC contribute to APR's overall risk assessment for these components. Available data from the APR show no statistically significant difference in the overall risk of major birth defects for FTC or TAF compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) (see Data ) . The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15\u201320%. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with the components of BIKTARVY at exposures that were either not maternally toxic (rabbits) or greater than (rats and mice) those in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) ( see Data ). During organogenesis, systemic exposures (AUC) to BIC were approximately 36 (rats) and 0.6 times (rabbits), to FTC were approximately 60 (mice) and 108 times (rabbits), and to TAF were approximately 2 (rats) and 78 times (rabbits) the exposure at the RHD of BIKTARVY. In rat pre/postnatal development studies, maternal systemic exposures (AUC) were 30 times (BIC), 60 times (FTC), and 19 times (TDF) the exposures of each component in humans at the RHD. Data Human Data Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to the components of BIKTARVY are compared with a U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks gestation. Bictegravir (BIC): Data from an observational study in Botswana showed that dolutegravir, another integrase inhibitor, was associated with increased risk of neural tube defects when administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. Data available to date from other sources including the APR, clinical trials, and postmarketing data are insufficient to address this risk with BIC. There are an insufficient number of reports to the APR to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects associated with BIC exposure. The APR has received prospective reports of 3 birth defects among 100 (3.0%) first trimester exposures to BIC-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births. No birth defects were reported among 40 exposures during the second/third trimester. Emtricitabine (FTC): Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 5,400 exposures to FTC-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 3,900 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,500 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2.6% (95% CI: 2.2% to 3.2%) and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.7%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to FTC-containing regimens. Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF): Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 660 exposures to TAF-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 520 exposed in the first trimester and over 130 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 4.2% (95% CI: 2.6% to 6.3%) and 3.0% (95% CI: 0.8% to 7.5%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to TAF-containing regimens. Animal Data Bictegravir: BIC was administered orally to pregnant rats (5, 30, or 300 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day) on gestation days 7 through 17, and 7 through 19, respectively. No adverse embryo-fetal effects were observed in rats and rabbits at BIC exposures (AUC) of up to approximately 36 (rats) and 0.6 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD of BIKTARVY. Spontaneous abortion, increased clinical signs [fecal changes, thin body, and cold-to-touch], and decreased body weight were observed at a maternally toxic dose in rabbits (1000 mg/kg/day; approximately 1.4 times higher than human exposure at the RHD). In a pre/postnatal development study, BIC was administered orally to pregnant rats (up to 300 mg/kg/day) from gestation days 6 to lactation/post-partum day 24. No significant adverse effects were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through lactation at maternal and pup exposures (AUC) of approximately 30 and 11 times higher, respectively, than human exposures at the RHD. Emtricitabine: FTC was administered orally to pregnant mice (250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day) through organogenesis (on gestation days 6 through 15, and 7 through 19, respectively). No significant toxicological effects were observed in embryo-fetal toxicity studies performed with emtricitabine in mice at exposures approximately 60 times higher and in rabbits at approximately 108 times higher than human exposures at the RHD. In a pre/postnatal development study with FTC, mice were administered doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day; no significant adverse effects directly related to drug were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through sexual maturity at daily exposures (AUC) of approximately 60 times higher than human exposures at the RHD. Tenofovir alafenamide: TAF was administered orally to pregnant rats (25, 100, or 250 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day) through organogenesis (on gestation days 6 through 17, and 7 through 20, respectively). No adverse embryo-fetal effects were observed in rats and rabbits at TAF exposures of approximately 2 (rats) and 78 (rabbits) times higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended daily dose of BIKTARVY. TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir; the observed tenofovir exposure in rats and rabbits were 55 (rats) and 86 (rabbits) times higher than human tenofovir exposures at the RHD. Since TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir and lower tenofovir exposures in rats and mice were observed after TAF administration compared to TDF administration, a pre/postnatal development study in rats was conducted only with TDF. Doses up to 600 mg/kg/day were administered through lactation; no adverse effects were observed in the offspring on gestation day 7 [and lactation day 20] at tenofovir exposures of approximately 12 [19] times higher than the exposures in humans at the RHD of BIKTARVY.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY have been established as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg: who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no known or suspected resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir [see Indications and Usage (1) , and Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] . Use of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg is supported by the following: trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] an open-label trial in three age-based cohorts of virologically-suppressed pediatric subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] Cohort 1: 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 48 (N=50), Cohort 2: 6 to less than 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 24 (N=50), and Cohort 3: at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg through Week 24 (N=22). No pediatric subjects 2 years of age were enrolled; of the 6 pediatric subjects who were 3 years of age at enrollment, 3 subjects weighed between 14 to less than 15 kg. The safety and efficacy of BIKTARVY in these pediatric subjects were similar to that in adults, and there was no clinically significant change in exposure for the components of BIKTARVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] .

    "dosage_and_administration": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Follow indication-specific dosage and administration recommendations. In a 3 month interval, do not exceed a total dose of: \u2022 Adults: 400 Units \u2022 Pediatrics: the lesser of 10 Units/kg or 340 Units ( 2.1 ) See Preparation and Dilution Technique for instructions on BOTOX reconstitution, storage, and preparation before injection ( 2.2 ) Overactive Bladder: Recommended total dose 100 Units, as 0.5 mL (5 Units) injections across 20 sites into the detrusor ( 2.3 ) Adult Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition: Recommended total dose 200 Units, as 1 mL (~6.7 Units) injections across 30 sites into the detrusor ( 2.3 ) Pediatric Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition: 0.5 mL injections across 20 sites into the detrusor ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Greater than or equal to 34 kg: Recommended total dose is 200 Units \u2022 Less than 34 kg: Recommended total dose is 6 Units/kg Chronic Migraine: Recommended total dose 155 Units, as 0.1 mL (5 Units) injections per each site divided across 7 head/neck muscles ( 2.5 ) Adult Upper Limb Spasticity: Recommended total dose up to 400 Units divided among affected muscles ( 2.6 ) Adult Lower Limb Spasticity: Recommended total dose 300 Units to 400 Units divided across ankle and toe muscles ( 2.6 ) Pediatric Upper Limb Spasticity: Recommended total dose 3 Units/kg to 6 Units/kg (maximum 200 Units) divided among affected muscles ( 2.7 ) Pediatric Lower Limb Spasticity: Recommended total dose 4 Units/kg to 8 Units/kg (maximum 300 Units) divided among affected muscles ( 2.7 ) Cervical Dystonia: Base dosing on the patient\u2019s head and neck position, localization of pain, muscle hypertrophy, patient response, and adverse event history; use lower initial dose in botulinum toxin na\u00efve patients ( 2.8 ) Axillary Hyperhidrosis: 50 Units per axilla ( 2.9 ) Blepharospasm: 1.25 Units-2.5 Units into each of 3 sites per affected eye ( 2.10 ) Strabismus: The dose is based on prism diopter correction or previous response to treatment with BOTOX ( 2.11 ) Figure 1: Injection Pattern for Intradetrusor Injections for Treatment of Overactive Bladder and Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Diagrams 1-4: Recommended Injection Sites (A through G) for Chronic Migraine A close up of a piece of paper Description automatically generated Figure 3: Injection Sites for Adult Lower Limb Spasticity Figure 4: Injection Sites for Pediatric Upper Limb Spasticity Figure 5 Figure 6: Injection Pattern for Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis 2.1 Instructions for Safe Use The potency Units of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Description ( 11 )] . Indication specific dosage and administration recommendations should be followed. When initiating treatment, the lowest recommended dose should be used. In treating adult patients for one or more indications, the maximum cumulative dose should not exceed 400 Units, in a 3-month interval. In pediatric patients, the total dose should not exceed the lower of 10 Units/kg body weight or 340 Units, in a 3-month interval [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . The safe and effective use of BOTOX depends upon proper storage of the product, selection of the correct dose, and proper reconstitution and administration techniques. An understanding of standard electromyographic techniques is also required for treatment of strabismus, upper or lower limb spasticity, and may be useful for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Physicians administering BOTOX must understand the relevant neuromuscular and structural anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures and disease, especially when injecting near the lungs. Do not use BOTOX and contact AbbVie (1-800-678-1605) if: the tamper evident features on the carton appear to be broken or compromised, or the U.S. License number 1889 is not present on the vial label and carton labeling [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . 2.2 Preparation and Dilution Technique Prior to injection, reconstitute each vacuum-dried vial of BOTOX with only sterile, preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Draw up the proper amount of diluent in the appropriate size syringe (see Table 1 , or for specific instructions for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition, see Section 2.3 ), and slowly inject the diluent into the vial. Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Gently mix BOTOX with the diluent by rotating the vial. Record the date and time of reconstitution on the space on the label. BOTOX should be administered within 24 hours after reconstitution. During this time period, unused reconstituted BOTOX should be stored in a refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) for up to 24 hours until time of use. BOTOX vials are for single-dose only. Discard any unused portion. Table 1: Dilution Instructions for BOTOX Vials (100 Units and 200 Units)** Diluent* Added to 100 Unit Vial Resulting Dose Units per 0.1 mL Diluent* Added to 200 Unit Vial Resulting Dose Units per 0.1 mL 1 mL 2 mL 4 mL 8 mL 10 mL 10 Units 5 Units 2.5 Units 1.25 Units 1 Unit 1 mL 2 mL 4 mL 8 mL 10 mL 20 Units 10 Units 5 Units 2.5 Units 2 Units *Preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Only **For Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Dilution, see Section 2.3 Note: These dilutions are calculated for an injection volume of 0.1 mL. A decrease or increase in the BOTOX dose is also possible by administering a smaller or larger injection volume - from 0.05 mL (50% decrease in dose) to 0.15 mL (50% increase in dose). An injection of BOTOX is prepared by drawing into an appropriately sized sterile syringe an amount of the properly reconstituted toxin slightly greater than the intended dose. Air bubbles in the syringe barrel are expelled and the syringe is attached to an appropriate injection needle. Patency of the needle should be confirmed. A new, sterile needle and syringe should be used to enter the vial on each occasion for removal of BOTOX. Reconstituted BOTOX should be clear, colorless, and free of particulate matter. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and whenever the solution and the container permit. 2.3 Adult Bladder Dysfunction General Patients must not have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the time of treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics, except aminoglycosides, [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] should be administered 1-3 days pre-treatment, on the treatment day, and 1-3 days post-treatment to reduce the likelihood of procedure-related UTI. Patients should discontinue anti-platelet therapy at least 3 days before the injection procedure. Patients on anti-coagulant therapy need to be managed appropriately to decrease the risk of bleeding. Appropriate caution should be exercised when performing a cystoscopy. Overactive Bladder An intravesical instillation of diluted local anesthetic with or without sedation may be used prior to injection, per local site practice. If a local anesthetic instillation is performed, the bladder should be drained and irrigated with sterile saline before injection. The recommended dose is 100 Units of BOTOX, and is the maximum recommended dose. The recommended dilution is 100 Units/10 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (see Table 1 ). Dispose of any unused saline. Reconstituted BOTOX (100 Units/10 mL) is injected into the detrusor muscle via a flexible or rigid cystoscope, avoiding the trigone. The bladder should be instilled with enough saline to achieve adequate visualization for the injections, but over-distension should be avoided. The injection needle should be filled (primed) with approximately 1 mL of reconstituted BOTOX prior to the start of injections (depending on the needle length) to remove any air. The needle should be inserted approximately 2 mm into the detrusor, and 20 injections of 0.5 mL each (total volume of 10 mL) should be spaced approximately 1 cm apart (see Figure 1 ). For the final injection, approximately 1 mL of sterile normal saline should be injected so that the remaining BOTOX in the needle is delivered to the bladder. After the injections are given, patients should demonstrate their ability to void prior to leaving the clinic. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes post-injection and until a spontaneous void has occurred. Patients should be considered for reinjection when the clinical effect of the previous injection has diminished (median time until patients qualified for the second treatment of BOTOX in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies was 169 days [~24 weeks]), but no sooner than 12 weeks from the prior bladder injection. Figure 1 : Injection Pattern for Intradetrusor Injections for Treatment of Overactive Bladder and Detrusor Overactivity A ssociated with a Neurologic Condition Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition An intravesical instillation of diluted local anesthetic with or without sedation, or general anesthesia may be used prior to injection, per local site practice. If a local anesthetic instillation is performed, the bladder should be drained and irrigated with sterile saline before injection. The recommended dose is 200 Units of BOTOX per treatment, and should not be exceeded. 200 Unit Vial of BOTOX Reconstitute a 200 Unit vial of BOTOX with 6 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and mix the vial gently. Draw 2 mL from the vial into each of three 10 mL syringes. Complete the reconstitution by adding 8 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP into each of the 10 mL syringes, and mix gently. This will result in three 10 mL syringes each containing 10 mL (~67 Units in each), for a total of 200 Units of reconstituted BOTOX. Use immediately after reconstitution in the syringe. Dispose of any unused saline. 100 Unit Vial of BOTOX Reconstitute two 100 Unit vials of BOTOX, each with 6 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and mix the vials gently. Draw 4 mL from each vial into each of two 10 mL syringes. Draw the remaining 2 mL from each vial into a third 10 mL syringe for a total of 4 mL in each syringe. Complete the reconstitution by adding 6 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP into each of the 10 mL syringes, and mix gently. This will result in three 10 mL syringes each containing 10 mL (~67 Units in each), for a total of 200 Units of reconstituted BOTOX. Use immediately after reconstitution in the syringe. Dispose of any unused saline. Reconstituted BOTOX (200 Units/30 mL) is injected into the detrusor muscle via a flexible or rigid cystoscope, avoiding the trigone. The bladder should be instilled with enough saline to achieve adequate visualization for the injections, but over-distension should be avoided. The injection needle should be filled (primed) with approximately 1 mL of reconstituted BOTOX prior to the start of injections (depending on the needle length) to remove any air. The needle should be inserted approximately 2 mm into the detrusor, and 30 injections of 1 mL (~6.7 Units) each (total volume of 30 mL) should be spaced approximately 1 cm apart (see Figure 1 ). For the final injection, approximately 1 mL of sterile normal saline should be injected so that the remaining BOTOX in the needle is delivered to the bladder. After the injections are given, the saline used for bladder wall visualization should be drained. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes post-injection. Patients should be considered for re-injection when the clinical effect of the previous injection diminishes (median time to qualification for re-treatment in the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies was 295-337 days [42-48 weeks] for BOTOX 200 Units), but no sooner than 12 weeks from the prior bladder injection. 2.4 Pediatric Detrusor Overactivity A ssociated with a Neurologic Condition Patients must not have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the time of treatment. Oral prophylactic antibiotics, except aminoglycosides, [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] should be administered 1-3 days pre-treatment, on the treatment day, and 1-3 days post-treatment to reduce the likelihood of procedure-related UTI. Alternatively, for patients receiving general anesthesia (or conscious sedation) for the treatment of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition, one dose of IV prophylactic antibiotics, except aminoglycosides, [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] may be administered prior to treatment administration on the day of treatment. Patients should discontinue anti-platelet therapy at least 3 days before the injection procedure. Patients on anti-coagulant therapy need to be managed appropriately to decrease the risk of bleeding. Appropriate caution should be exercised when performing a cystoscopy. In patients 5 years to less than 12 years of age: Consider general anesthesia (or conscious sedation) prior to injection, per local site practice. In patients 12 years of age or older: Consider an intravesical instillation of diluted local anesthetic with or without sedation, or general anesthesia prior to injection, per local site practice. At a minimum, consider a diluted instillation of local anesthetic for all age groups. If a local anesthetic instillation is performed, drain and irrigate the bladder with sterile saline before injection. If patient\u2019s body weight is greater than or equal to 34 kg, the recommended dosage is 200 Units of BOTOX per treatment administered as an intradetrusor injection after dilution: Reconstitute BOTOX to result in 20 Units BOTOX/mL in the vial(s): \u25e6 BOTOX 200 Unit vial: add 10 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and mix the vial gently. \u25e6 BOTOX 100 Unit vials: add 5 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to each of two 100 Unit vials of BOTOX and mix the vials gently. Draw 10 mL from the vial(s) into one 10 mL dosing syringe. Use immediately after reconstitution in the syringe. Dispose of any unused saline. If patient\u2019s body weight is less than 34 kg, the recommended dosage is 6 Units/kg body weight administered as a bladder injection after dilution (refer to Table 2): Reconstitute BOTOX to result in 20 Units BOTOX/mL in the vial(s): \u25e6 BOTOX 200 Unit vial: add 10 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and mix the vial gently. \u25e6 BOTOX 100 Unit vial(s): add 5 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to one 100 Unit vial of BOTOX (if final dose is less than or equal to 100 U) or to each of two 100 Unit vials of BOTOX (if final dose is greater than 100 U) and mix the vial(s) gently. Refer to Table 2 for dilution instructions (i.e., the amount of reconstituted BOTOX and additional diluent to draw into one 10 mL dosing syringe). Use BOTOX immediately after reconstitution in the syringe. Dispose of any unused preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.

The bladder should be instilled with enough saline to achieve adequate visualization for the injections, but over-distension should be avoided. The injection needle should be filled (primed) with approximately 1 mL of reconstituted BOTOX prior to the start of injections (depending on the needle length) to remove any air. The needle should be inserted approximately 2 mm into the detrusor, and 20 injections of 0.5 mL each (total volume of 10 mL) should be spaced approximately 1 cm apart (see Figure 1 ). For the final injection, approximately 1 mL of sterile normal saline should be injected so that the remaining BOTOX in the needle is delivered to the bladder. After the injections are given, the saline used for bladder wall visualization should be drained. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes post-injection. Patients should be considered for re-injection when the clinical effect of the previous injection diminishes (median time to qualification for re-treatment in the double-blind, parallel group clinical study was 207 days [30 weeks] for BOTOX 200 Units), but no sooner than 12 weeks from the prior bladder injection. 2. 5 Chronic Migraine The recommended dilution is 200 Units/4 mL or 100 Units/2 mL, with a final concentration of 5 Units per 0.1 mL (see Table 1 ). The recommended dose for treating chronic migraine is 155 Units administered intramuscularly using a sterile 30-gauge, 0.5 inch needle as 0.1 mL (5 Units) injections per each site. Injections should be divided across 7 specific head/neck muscle areas as specified in the diagrams and Table 3 below. A one inch needle may be needed in the neck region for patients with thick neck muscles. With the exception of the procerus muscle, which should be injected at one site (midline), all muscles should be injected bilaterally with half the number of injection sites administered to the left, and half to the right side of the head and neck. The recommended re-treatment schedule is every 12 weeks.

The recommended dilution is 200 Units/4 mL or 100 Units/2 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (see Table 1 ). The lowest recommended starting dose should be used, and no more than 50 Units per site should generally be administered. An appropriately sized needle (e.g., 25-30 gauge) may be used for superficial muscles, and a longer 22 gauge needle may be used for deeper musculature. Localization of the involved muscles with techniques such as needle electromyographic guidance, nerve stimulation, or ultrasound is recommended. Repeat BOTOX treatment may be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but generally no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection. The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may necessitate alterations in the dose of BOTOX and muscles to be injected. Adult Upper Limb Spasticity In clinical trials, doses ranging from 75 Units to 400 Units were divided among selected muscles (see Table 4 and Figure 2 ) at a given treatment session. Table 4: BOTOX Dosing by Muscle for Adult Upper Limb Spasticity Muscle Recommended Dose Total Dosage (Number of Sites) Biceps Brachii 60 Units to 200 Units divided in 2 to 4 sites Brachioradialis 45 Units to 75 Units divided in 1 to 2 sites Brachialis 30 Units to 50 Units divided in 1 to 2 sites Pronator Teres 15 Units to 25 Units in 1 site Pronator Quadratus 10 Units to 50 Units in 1 site Flexor Carpi Radialis 12.5 Units to 50 Units in 1 site Flexor Carpi Ulnaris 12.5 Units to 50 Units in 1 site Flexor Digitorum Profundus 30 Units to 50 Units in 1 site Flexor Digitorum Sublimis 30 Units to 50 Units in 1 site Lumbricals/Interossei 5 Units to 10 Units in 1 site Adductor Pollicis 20 Units in 1 site Flexor Pollicis Longus 20 Units in 1 site Flexor pollicis brevis/ Opponens pollicis 5 Units to 25 Units in 1 site Figure 2 : Injection Sites for Adult Upper Limb Spasticity Adult Lower Limb Spasticity The recommended dose for treating adult lower limb spasticity is 300 Units to 400 Units divided among 5 muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus) (see Table 5 and Figure 3 ). Table 5: BOTOX Dosing by Muscle for Adult Lower Limb Spasticity Muscl e Recommended Dose Total Dosage (Number of Sites) Gastrocnemius medial head 75 Units divided in 3 sites Gastrocnemius lateral head 75 Units divided in 3 sites Soleus 75 Units divided in 3 sites Tibialis Posterior 75 Units divided in 3 sites Flexor hallucis longus 50 Units divided in 2 sites Flexor digitorum longus 50 Units divided in 2 sites Figure 3 : Inj e ction Sites for Adult Lower Limb Spa s t icity 2. 7 Pediatric Spasticity General Localization of the involved muscles with techniques such as needle electromyographic guidance, nerve stimulation, or ultrasound is recommended. When treating both lower limbs or the upper and lower limbs in combination, the total dose should not exceed the lower of 10 Units/kg body weight or 340 Units, in a 3-month interval [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.6 )] . Additional general adult spasticity dosing information is also applicable to pediatric spasticity patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Pediatric Upper Limb Spasticity The recommended dose for treating pediatric upper limb spasticity is 3 Units/kg to 6 Units/kg divided among the affected muscles (see Table 6 and Figure 4 ). The total dose of BOTOX administered per treatment session in the upper limb should not exceed 6 Units/kg or 200 Units, whichever is lower. Table 6: BOTOX Dosing by Muscle for Pediatric Upper Limb Spasticity Muscle Recommended Dose and Number of Sites Biceps Brachii 1.5 Units/kg to 3 Units/kg divided in 4 sites Brachialis 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Brachioradialis 0.5 Units/kg to 1 Unit/kg divided in 2 sites Flexor Carpi Radialis 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Flexor Carpi Ulnaris 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Flexor Digitorum Profundus 0.5 Units/kg to 1 Unit/kg divided in 2 sites Flexor Digitorum Sublimis 0.5 Units/kg to 1 Unit/kg divided in 2 sites Figure 4: Injection Sites for Pediatric Upper Limb Spasticity Pediatric Lower Limb Spasticity The recommended dose for treating pediatric lower limb spasticity is 4 Units/kg to 8 Units/kg divided among the affected muscles (see Table 7 and Figure 5 ). The total dose of BOTOX administered per treatment session in the lower limb should not exceed 8 Units/kg or 300 Units, whichever is lower. Table 7: BOTOX Dosing by Muscle for Pediatric Lower Limb Spasticity Muscl e Recommend e d Dose Total Dosage (Number of Sites) Gastrocnemius medial head 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Gastrocnemius lateral head 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Soleus 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Tibialis Posterior 1 Unit/kg to 2 Units/kg divided in 2 sites Figure 5 : Injection Sites for Pediatric Lower Limb Spasticity 2. 8 Cervical Dystonia A double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled patients who had extended histories of receiving and tolerating BOTOX injections, with prior individualized adjustment of dose. The mean BOTOX dose administered to patients in this study was 236 Units (25th to 75th percentile range of 198 Units to 300 Units). The BOTOX dose was divided among the affected muscles [see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 )]. Dosing in initial and sequential treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual patient based on the patient\u2019s head and neck position, localization of pain, muscle hypertrophy, patient response, and adverse event history. The initial dose for a patient without prior use of BOTOX should be at a lower dose, with subsequent dosing adjusted based on individual response. Limiting the total dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle to 100 Units or less may decrease the occurrence of dysphagia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.5 , 5.6 )]. The recommended dilution is 200 Units/2 mL, 200 Units/4 mL, 100 Units/1 mL, or 100 Units/2 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, depending on volume and number of injection sites desired to achieve treatment objectives (see Table 1 ). In general, no more than 50 Units per site should be administered using a sterile needle (e.g., 25-30 gauge) of an appropriate length. Localization of the involved muscles with electromyographic guidance may be useful. Clinical improvement generally begins within the first two weeks after injection with maximum clinical benefit at approximately six weeks post-injection. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled study most subjects were observed to have returned to pre-treatment status by 3 months post-treatment. 2. 9 Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis The recommended dose is 50 Units per axilla. The hyperhidrotic area to be injected should be defined using standard staining techniques, e.g., Minor\u2019s Iodine-Starch Test. The recommended dilution is 100 Units/4 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (see Table 1 ). Using a sterile 30 gauge needle, 50 Units of BOTOX (2 mL) is injected intradermally in 0.1 to 0.2 mL aliquots to each axilla evenly distributed in multiple sites (10-15) approximately 1-2 cm apart. Repeat injections for hyperhidrosis should be administered when the clinical effect of a previous injection diminishes. Instructions for the Minor\u2019s Iodine-Starch Test Procedure: Patients should shave underarms and abstain from use of over-the-counter deodorants or antiperspirants for 24 hours prior to the test. Patient should be resting comfortably without exercise or hot drinks for approximately 30 minutes prior to the test. Dry the underarm area and then immediately paint it with iodine solution. Allow the area to dry, then lightly sprinkle the area with starch powder. Gently blow off any excess starch powder. The hyperhidrotic area will develop a deep blue-black color over approximately 10 minutes. Each injection site has a ring of effect of up to approximately 2 cm in diameter. To minimize the area of no effect, the injection sites should be evenly spaced as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6 : Injection Pattern for Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis Each dose is injected to a depth of approximately 2 mm and at a 45\u00b0 angle to the skin surface, with the bevel side up to minimize leakage and to ensure the injections remain intradermal. If injection sites are marked in ink, do not inject BOTOX directly through the ink mark to avoid a permanent tattoo effect. 2. 10 Blepharospasm For blepharospasm, reconstituted BOTOX is injected using a sterile, 27-30 gauge needle without electromyographic guidance. The initial recommended dose is 1.25 Units-2.5 Units (0.05 mL to 0.1 mL volume at each site) injected into the medial and lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid. Avoiding injection near the levator palpebrae superioris may reduce the complication of ptosis. Avoiding medial lower lid injections, and thereby reducing diffusion into the inferior oblique, may reduce the complication of diplopia. Ecchymosis occurs easily in the soft eyelid tissues. This can be prevented by applying pressure at the injection site immediately after the injection. The recommended dilution to achieve 1.25 Units is 100 Units/8 mL; for 2.5 Units it is 100 Units/4 mL (see Table 1 ). In general, the initial effect of the injections is seen within three days and reaches a peak at one to two weeks post-treatment. Each treatment lasts approximately three months, following which the procedure can be repeated. At repeat treatment sessions, the dose may be increased up to two-fold if the response from the initial treatment is considered insufficient, usually defined as an effect that does not last longer than two months. However, there appears to be little benefit obtainable from injecting more than 5 Units per site. Some tolerance may be found when BOTOX is used in treating blepharospasm if treatments are given any more frequently than every three months, and is rare to have the effect be permanent. The cumulative dose of BOTOX treatment for blepharospasm in a 30-day period should not exceed 200 Units. 2. 1 1 Strabismus BOTOX is intended for injection into extraocular muscles utilizing the electrical activity recorded from the tip of the injection needle as a guide to placement within the target muscle. Injection without surgical exposure or electromyographic guidance should not be attempted. Physicians should be familiar with electromyographic technique. To prepare the eye for BOTOX injection, it is recommended that several drops of a local anesthetic and an ocular decongestant be given several minutes prior to injection. The volume of BOTOX injected for treatment of strabismus should be between 0.05-0.15 mL per muscle. The initial listed doses of the reconstituted BOTOX [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] typically create paralysis of the injected muscles beginning one to two days after injection and increasing in intensity during the first week. The paralysis lasts for 2-6 weeks and gradually resolves over a similar time period. Overcorrections lasting over six months have been rare. About one half of patients will require subsequent doses because of inadequate paralytic response of the muscle to the initial dose, or because of mechanical factors such as large deviations or restrictions, or because of the lack of binocular motor fusion to stabilize the alignment. Initial D oses in Units Use the lower listed doses for treatment of small deviations. Use the larger doses only for large deviations. For vertical muscles, and for horizontal strabismus of less than 20 prism diopters: 1.25 Units-2.5 Units in any one muscle. For horizontal strabismus of 20 prism diopters to 50 prism diopters: 2.5 Units-5 Units in any one muscle. For persistent VI nerve palsy of one month or longer duration: 1.25 Units-2.5 Units in the medial rectus muscle. Subsequent D oses for R esidual or R ecurrent S trabismus It is recommended that patients be re-examined 7-14 days after each injection to assess the effect of that dose. Patients experiencing adequate paralysis of the target muscle that require subsequent injections should receive a dose comparable to the initial dose. Subsequent doses for patients experiencing incomplete paralysis of the target muscle may be increased up to two-fold compared to the previously administered dose. Subsequent injections should not be administered until the effects of the previous dose have dissipated as evidenced by substantial function in the injected and adjacent muscles. The maximum recommended dose as a single injection for any one muscle is 25 Units. The recommended dilution to achieve 1.25 Units is 100 Units/8 mL; for 2.5 Units it is 100 Units/4 mL (see Table 1 ).",
    "mechanism_of_action": "12.1 Mechanism of Action BOTOX blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or autonomic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, BOTOX produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop. There is evidence that reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing muscle denervation produced by BOTOX. When injected intradermally, BOTOX produces temporary chemical denervation of the sweat gland resulting in local reduction in sweating. Following intradetrusor injection, BOTOX affects the efferent pathways of detrusor activity via inhibition of acetylcholine release.",
    "boxed_warning": "WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of BOTOX and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to the se symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia an d spasticity and at lower doses [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

    "warnings_and_cautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Spread of toxin effects; swallowing and breathing difficulties can lead to death. Seek immediate medical attention if respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties occur ( 5.1 , 5.6 ) Potency Units of BOTOX are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products ( 5.2 , 11 ) Potential serious adverse reactions after BOTOX injections for unapproved uses ( 5.3 ) Concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment ( 5.5 ) Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function ( 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.10 ) Corneal exposure and ulceration due to reduced blinking may occur with BOTOX treatment of blepharospasm ( 5.8 ) Retrobulbar hemorrhages and compromised retinal circulation may occur with BOTOX treatment of strabismus ( 5.9 ) Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections in patients treated for spasticity ( 5.10 ) Urinary tract infections in patients treated for OAB ( 5.12 ) Urinary retention: Post-void residual urine volume should be monitored in patients treated for OAB or adult detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition who do not catheterize routinely, particularly patients with multiple sclerosis or diabetes mellitus. ( 5.13 ) 5. 1 Spread of Toxin Effect Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur. No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with BOTOX for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis at the recommended dose (100 Units), strabismus, or for chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported. 5.2 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products The potency Units of BOTOX are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description ( 11 )] . 5.3 Serious Adverse Reactions with Unapproved Use Serious adverse reactions, including excessive weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia, with some adverse reactions associated with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received BOTOX injections for unapproved uses. In these cases, the adverse reactions were not necessarily related to distant spread of toxin, but may have resulted from the administration of BOTOX to the site of injection and/or adjacent structures. In several of the cases, patients had pre-existing dysphagia or other significant disabilities. There is insufficient information to identify factors associated with an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with the unapproved uses of BOTOX. The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for unapproved uses have not been established. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and/or immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, serum sickness, urticaria, soft tissue edema, and dyspnea. If such a reaction occurs, further injection of BOTOX should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted. One fatal case of anaphylaxis has been reported in which lidocaine was used as the diluent, and consequently the causal agent cannot be reliably determined. 5.5 Increased Risk of Clinically Significant Effects with Pre-Existing Neuromuscular Disorders Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored when given botulinum toxin. Patients with known or unrecognized neuromuscular disorders or neuromuscular junction disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphonia, dysarthria, severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from therapeutic doses of BOTOX [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.6 ) ] . 5.6 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties Treatment with BOTOX and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised. Treatment with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been postmarketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure. Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscle for the treatment of cervical dystonia have been reported to be at greater risk for dysphagia. Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may reduce the occurrence of dysphagia. Injections into the levator scapulae may be associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory infection and dysphagia. Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 5.7 Pulmonary Effects of BOTOX in Patients with Compromised Respiratory Status Treated for Spasticity or for Detrusor Overactivity Associated with a Neurologic Condition Patients with compromised respiratory status treated with BOTOX for spasticity should be monitored closely. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in adult patients treated for upper limb spasticity with stable reduced pulmonary function (defined as FEV 1 40-80% of predicted value and FEV 1 /FVC \u2264 0.75), the event rate in change of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) \u226515% or \u226520% was generally greater in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo (see Table 8 ). Table 8: Event Rate Per Patient Treatment Cycle Among Adult Upper Limb Spasticity Patients with Reduced Lung Function Who Experienced at Least a 15% or 20% Decrease in FVC From Baseline at Week 1, 6, 12 Post-injection with Up to Two Treatment Cycles with BOTOX or Placebo BOTOX 360 Units BOTOX 240 Units Placebo \u226515% \u226520% \u226515% \u226520% \u226515% \u226520% Week 1 4% 0% 3% 0% 7% 3% Week 6 7% 4% 4% 2% 2% 2% Week 12 10% 5% 2% 1% 4% 1% Differences from placebo were not statistically significant In adult spasticity patients with reduced lung function, upper respiratory tract infections were also reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo [se e Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in adult patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and restrictive lung disease of neuromuscular etiology [defined as FVC 50-80% of predicted value in patients with spinal cord injury between C5 and C8, or MS] the event rate in change of Forced Vital Capacity \u226515% or \u226520% was generally greater in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo (see Table 9 ).

Vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed. This may require protective drops, ointment, therapeutic soft contact lenses, or closure of the eye by patching or other means. 5.9 Retrobulbar Hemorrhages in Patients Treated with BOTOX for Strabismus During the administration of BOTOX for the treatment of strabismus, retrobulbar hemorrhages sufficient to compromise retinal circulation have occurred. It is recommended that appropriate instruments to decompress the orbit be accessible. 5.10 Bronchitis and Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Patients Treated for Spasticity Bronchitis was reported more frequently as an adverse reaction in adult patients treated for upper limb spasticity with BOTOX (3% at 251 Units-360 Units total dose), compared to placebo (1%). In adult patients with reduced lung function treated for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were also reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with BOTOX (11% at 360 Units total dose; 8% at 240 Units total dose) compared to placebo (6%). In adult patients treated for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently as an adverse reaction in patients treated with BOTOX (2% at 300 Units to 400 Units total dose) compared to placebo (1%). In pediatric patients treated for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently as an adverse reaction in patients treated with BOTOX (17% at 6 Units/kg and 10% at 3 Units/kg) compared to placebo (9%). In pediatric patients treated for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infection was not reported with an incidence greater than placebo. 5.11 Autonomic Dysreflexia in Patients Treated for Detrusor Overactivity Associated with a Neurologic Condition Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in adult patients treated with BOTOX 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively). 5.12 Urinary Tract Infections in Patients with Overactive Bladder BOTOX increases the incidence of urinary tract infection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Clinical trials for overactive bladder excluded patients with more than 2 UTIs in the past 6 months and those taking antibiotics chronically due to recurrent UTIs. Use of BOTOX for the treatment of overactive bladder in such patients and in patients with multiple recurrent UTIs during treatment should only be considered when the benefit is likely to outweigh the potential risk. 5.13 Urinary Retention in Adults Treated for Bladder Dysfunction Due to the risk of urinary retention, treat only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, for urinary retention. In patients who are not catheterizing, post-void residual (PVR) urine volume should be assessed within 2 weeks post-treatment and periodically as medically appropriate up to 12 weeks, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis or diabetes mellitus. Depending on patient symptoms, institute catheterization if PVR urine volume exceeds 200 mL and continue until PVR falls below 200 mL. Instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience difficulty in voiding as catheterization may be required. The incidence and duration of urinary retention is described below for adult patients with overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition who received BOTOX or placebo injections. Overactive Bladder In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with OAB, the proportion of subjects who initiated clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX or placebo is shown in Table 10. The duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention is also shown.

The duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention is also shown. Table 12: Proportion of Adult Patients Not Using CIC at Baseline and then Catheterizing for Urinary Retention and Duration of Catheterization Following an Injection in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Timepoint BOTOX 200 Units (N=108) Placebo (N=104) Proportion of Patients Catheterizing for Urinary Retention At any time during complete treatment cycle 30.6% (n=33) 6.7% (n=7) Duration of Catheterization for Urinary Retention (Days) Median 289 358 Min, Max 1, 530 2, 379 Among adult patients not using CIC at baseline, those with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were more likely to require CIC post-injection than those with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) (see Table 13 ).

Catheterization for urinary retention was initiated in 15.2% (10/66) of patients following treatment with BOTOX 100 Units versus 2.6% (2/78) on placebo at any time during the complete treatment cycle. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention was 64 days for BOTOX 100 Units and 2 days for placebo. 5.14 Human Albumin and Transmission of Viral Diseases This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). There is a theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), but if that risk actually exists, the risk of transmission would also be considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases, CJD or vCJD have ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin contained in other licensed products.",

BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening, including: Problems breathing or swallowing Spread of toxin effects These problems can happen hours, days, to weeks after an injection of BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of these problems after treatment with BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic: Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing. These problems can happen hours, days, to weeks after an injection of BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic usually because the muscles that you use to breathe and swallow can become weak after the injection. Death can happen as a complication if you have severe problems with swallowing or breathing after treatment with BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic . People with certain breathing problems may need to use muscles in their neck to help them breathe. These people may be at greater risk for serious breathing problems with BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic . Swallowing problems may last for several months. People who cannot swallow well may need a feeding tube to receive food and water. If swallowing problems are severe, food or liquids may go into your lungs. People who already have swallowing or breathing problems before receiving BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic have the highest risk of getting these problems. Spread of toxin effects. In some cases, the effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas of the body away from the injection site and cause symptoms of a serious condition called botulism. The symptoms of botulism include: \u25cb loss of strength and muscle weakness all over the body \u25cb double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids \u25cb hoarseness or change or loss of voice (dysphonia) \u25cb trouble saying words clearly (dysarthria) \u25cb loss of bladder control \u25cb trouble breathing \u25cb trouble swallowing These symptoms can happen hours, days, to weeks after you receive an injection of BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic . These problems could make it unsafe for you to drive a car or do other dangerous activities. See \"What should I avoid while receiving BOTOX or BOTOX Cosmetic ?\" There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, severe underarm sweating, blepharospasm, or strabismus, or when BOTOX Cosmetic has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines, crow\u2019s feet lines, forehead lines, or vertical bands connecting the jaw and neck. What are BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic? BOTOX is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: to treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents (urge urinary incontinence), a strong need to urinate right away (urgency) and urinating often (frequency) in adults when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken. to treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults with overactive bladder due to neurologic disease when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken. to treat overactive bladder due to a neurologic disease in children 5 years of age and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken. to prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day. to treat increased muscle stiffness in people 2 years of age and older with spasticity. to treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in adults. to treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years of age and older. BOTOX is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough. BOTOX Cosmetic is a prescription medicine for adults that is injected into muscles and used for a short period of time (temporary) to improve the look of: moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) moderate to severe crow\u2019s feet lines moderate to severe forehead lines moderate to severe vertical bands connecting the jaw and neck (platysma bands) You may receive treatment for frown lines, crow\u2019s feet lines, forehead lines, and vertical bands connecting the jaw and neck at the same time. It is not known whether BOTOX is safe and effective in people younger than: 18 years of age for treatment of overactive bladder with urinary incontinence 5 years of age for the treatment of overactive bladder due to a neurologic disease 18 years of age for treatment of chronic migraine 16 years of age for treatment of cervical dystonia 18 years of age for treatment of hyperhidrosis 12 years of age for treatment of strabismus or blepharospasm 2 years of age for treatment of spasticity BOTOX Cosmetic is not recommended for use in children younger than 18 years of age. It is not known whether BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic are safe and effective to prevent headaches in people with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).

BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic contain the same active ingredient in the same formulation, but with different labeled Indications and Usage. Therefore, adverse reactions observed with the use of BOTOX Cosmetic also have the potential to be observed with the use of BOTOX. In general, adverse reactions occur within the first week following injection of BOTOX and, while generally transient, may have a duration of several months or longer. Localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and/or bleeding/bruising may be associated with the injection. Symptoms associated with flu-like symptoms (e.g., nausea, fever, myalgia) have been reported after treatment. Needle-related pain and/or anxiety may result in vasovagal responses (including syncope, hypotension), which may require appropriate medical therapy. Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action of botulinum toxin. However, weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to spread of toxin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Overactive Bladder Table 14 presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for overactive bladder occurring within 12 weeks of the first BOTOX treatment. Table 14: Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22652% of BOTOX Treated Patients and More Often than in Placebo-Treated Patients Within the First 12 Weeks after Intradetrusor Injection, in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in Patients with OAB Adverse Reactions BOTOX 100 Units (N=552) % Placebo (N=542) % Urinary tract infection Dysuria Urinary retention Bacteriuria Residual urine volume* 18 9 6 4 3 6 7 0 2 0 *Elevated PVR not requiring catheterization. Catheterization was required for PVR \u2265350 mL regardless of symptoms, and for PVR \u2265200 mL to <350 mL with symptoms (e.g., voiding difficulty). A higher incidence of urinary tract infection was observed in patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX 100 Units and placebo than in patients without diabetes, as shown in Table 15. Table 15: Proportion of Patients Experiencing Urinary Tract Infection Following an Injection in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in OAB According to History of Diabetes Mellitus Patients with Diabet es Patients without D iabet es B OTOX 100 Units (N=81) % Placebo (N=69) % B OTOX 100 Units (N=526) % Placebo (N=516) % Urinary tract infection (UTI) 31 12 26 10 The incidence of UTI increased in patients who experienced a maximum post-void residual (PVR) urine volume \u2265200 mL following BOTOX injection compared to those with a maximum PVR <200 mL following BOTOX injection, 44% versus 23%, respectively. No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing during an open-label, uncontrolled extension trial. Adult Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Table 16 presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies within 12 weeks of injection for patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition treated with BOTOX 200 Units. Table 16: Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22652% of BOTOX-Treated Patients and More Frequent than in Placebo-Treated Patients Within the First 12 Weeks after Intradetrusor Injection in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions BOTOX 200 Units (N=262) % Placebo (N=272) % Urinary tract infection Urinary retention Hematuria 24 17 4 17 3 3 The following adverse reactions with BOTOX 200 Units were reported at any time following initial injection and prior to re-injection or study exit (median duration of exposure was 44 weeks): urinary tract infections (49%), urinary retention (17%), constipation (4%), muscular weakness (4%), dysuria (4%), fall (3%), gait disturbance (3%), and muscle spasm (2%). In the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the MS exacerbation annualized rate (i.e., number of MS exacerbation events per patient-year) was 0.23 for BOTOX and 0.20 for placebo. No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing. Table 17 presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in a placebo-controlled, double-blind post-approval 52 week study with BOTOX 100 Units (Study NDO-3) conducted in MS patients with urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. These patients were not adequately managed with at least one anticholinergic agent and not catheterized at baseline. The table below presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions within 12 weeks of injection. Table 17: Adverse Reactions Reported in a Post Approval Study (NDO-3) by >2% of BOTOX Treated Patients and More Frequent than in Placebo-Treated Patients Within the First 12 Weeks after Intradetrusor Injection Adverse Reactions BOTOX 100 Unit s (N=66) % Placebo (N=78) % Urinary tract infection Bacteriuria Urinary retention Dysuria Residual urine volume* 26 9 15 5 17 6 5 1 1 1 * Elevated PVR not requiring catheterization. Catheterization was required for PVR \u2265350 mL regardless of symptoms, and for PVR \u2265200 mL to <350 mL with symptoms (e.g., voiding difficulty). The following adverse events with BOTOX 100 Units were reported at any time following initial injection and prior to re-injection or study exit (median duration of exposure was 51 weeks): urinary tract infections (39%), bacteriuria (18%), urinary retention (17%), residual urine volume* (17%), dysuria (9%), and hematuria (5%). No difference in the MS exacerbation annualized rate (i.e., number of MS exacerbating events per patient-year) was observed (BOTOX =0, placebo =0.07). Pediatric Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Table 18 presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in Study 191622-120, a double-blind, parallel-group study conducted in pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. These patients were not adequately managed with at least one anticholinergic agent and were using clean intermittent catheterization at baseline [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. The table below presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions during the 12 weeks following intradetrusor administration of BOTOX 200 Units. Table 18: Adverse Reactions Reported by \u2265 3% of BOTOX Treated Pediatric Patients within the First 12 Weeks after Intradetrusor Injection, Study 191622-120 Adverse Reactions BOTOX 200 Unit (N=30) Urinary tract infection 2 (7%) Bacteriuria 6 (20%) Leukocyturia 2 (7%) Hematuria 1 (3%) No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing. The most common adverse reactions in patients who received BOTOX 6 U/kg and less than a total dose of 200 U in Study 191622-120 were urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteriuria and hematuria. Chronic Migraine In double-blind, placebo-controlled chronic migraine efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2), the discontinuation rate was 12% in the BOTOX treated group and 10% in the placebo-treated group. Discontinuations due to an adverse event were 4% in the BOTOX group and 1% in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation in the BOTOX group were neck pain, headache, worsening migraine, muscular weakness and eyelid ptosis. The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for chronic migraine appear in Table 19.

Severe worsening of migraine requiring hospitalization occurred in approximately 1% of BOTOX treated patients in Study 1 and Study 2, usually within the first week after treatment, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Adult Upper Limb Spasticity The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for adult upper limb spasticity appear in Table 20. Table 20: Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22652% of BOTOX Treated Patients and More Frequent than in Placebo-Treated Patients in Adult Upper Limb Spasticity Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions BOTOX 251 Units - 360 Units (N=115) % BOTOX 150 Units - 250 Units (N=188) % BOTOX <150 Units (N=54) % Placebo (N=182) % Gastrointestinal disorder Nausea 3 2 2 1 General disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue 3 2 2 0 Infections and infestations Bronchitis 3 2 0 1 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Pain in extremity Muscular weakness 6 0 5 4 9 2 4 1 Twenty-two adult patients, enrolled in double-blind placebo controlled studies, received 400 Units or higher of BOTOX for treatment of upper limb spasticity. In addition, 44 adults received 400 Units of BOTOX or higher for four consecutive treatments over approximately one year for treatment of upper limb spasticity. The type and frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients treated with 400 Units of BOTOX were similar to those reported in patients treated for upper limb spasticity with 360 Units of BOTOX. Adult Lower Limb Spasticity The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for adult lower limb spasticity appear in Table 21. Two hundred thirty-one patients enrolled in a double-blind placebo controlled study (Study 7) received 300 Units to 400 Units of BOTOX, and were compared with 233 patients who received placebo. Patients were followed for an average of 91 days after injection.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1), 78 patients were treated with 3 Units/kg of BOTOX, and 77 patients received 6 Units/kg to a maximum dose of 200 Units of BOTOX, and were compared to 79 patients who received placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. Patients were followed for an average of 91 days after injection.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2), 126 patients were treated with 4 Units/kg of BOTOX, and 128 patients received 8 Units/kg to a maximum dose of 300 Units of BOTOX, and were compared to 128 patients who received placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 ) ]. Patients were followed for an average of 89 days after injection.

Other events reported in 2-10% of patients in any one study in decreasing order of incidence include: increased cough, flu syndrome, back pain, rhinitis, dizziness, hypertonia, soreness at injection site, asthenia, oral dryness, speech disorder, fever, nausea, and drowsiness. Stiffness, numbness, diplopia, ptosis, and dyspnea have been reported. Dysphagia and symptomatic general weakness may be attributable to an extension of the pharmacology of BOTOX resulting from the spread of the toxin outside the injected muscles [see Warning s and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.6 )] . The most common severe adverse reaction associated with the use of BOTOX injection in patients with cervical dystonia is dysphagia with about 20% of these cases also reporting dyspnea [see Wa rnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.6 )] . Most dysphagia is reported as mild or moderate in severity. However, it may be associated with more severe signs and symptoms [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Additionally, reports in the literature include a case of a female patient who developed brachial plexopathy two days after injection of 120 Units of BOTOX for the treatment of cervical dystonia, and reports of dysphonia in patients who have been treated for cervical dystonia. Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3-10% of adult patients) following injection of BOTOX in double-blind studies included injection site pain and hemorrhage, non-axillary sweating, infection, pharyngitis, flu syndrome, headache, fever, neck or back pain, pruritus, and anxiety. The data reflect 346 patients exposed to BOTOX 50 Units and 110 patients exposed to BOTOX 75 Units in each axilla. Blepharospasm In a study of blepharospasm patients who received an average dose per eye of 33 Units (injected at 3 to 5 sites) of the currently manufactured BOTOX, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were ptosis (21%), superficial punctate keratitis (6%), and eye dryness (6%). Other events reported in prior clinical studies in decreasing order of incidence include: irritation, tearing, lagophthalmos, photophobia, ectropion, keratitis, diplopia, entropion, diffuse skin rash, and local swelling of the eyelid skin lasting for several days following eyelid injection. In two cases of VII nerve disorder, reduced blinking from BOTOX injection of the orbicularis muscle led to serious corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, corneal ulceration and a case of corneal perforation. Focal facial paralysis, syncope, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported after treatment of blepharospasm. Strabismus Extraocular muscles adjacent to the injection site can be affected, causing vertical deviation, especially with higher doses of BOTOX. The incidence rates of these adverse effects in 2058 adults who received a total of 3650 injections for horizontal strabismus was 17%. The incidence of ptosis has been reported to be dependent on the location of the injected muscles, 1% after inferior rectus injections, 16% after horizontal rectus injections and 38% after superior rectus injections. In a series of 5587 injections, retrobulbar hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of cases. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to onabotulinumtoxinA in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a long term, open-label study evaluating 326 cervical dystonia patients treated for an average of 9 treatment sessions with the current formulation of BOTOX, 4 (1.2%) patients had positive antibody tests. All 4 of these patients responded to BOTOX therapy at the time of the positive antibody test. However, 3 of these patients developed clinical resistance after subsequent treatment, while the fourth patient continued to respond to BOTOX therapy for the remainder of the study. One patient among the 445 hyperhidrosis patients (0.2%), two patients among the 380 adult upper limb spasticity patients (0.5%), and no patients among 406 migraine patients with analyzed specimens developed the presence of neutralizing antibodies. In one Phase 3 study and the open-label extension study in patients with pediatric lower limb spasticity, neutralizing antibodies developed in 2 of 264 patients (0.8%) treated with BOTOX for up to 5 treatment cycles. Both patients continued to experience clinical benefit following subsequent BOTOX treatments. In overactive bladder patients with analyzed specimens from the two phase 3 studies and the open-label extension study, neutralizing antibodies developed in 0 of 954 patients (0.0%) while receiving BOTOX 100 Unit doses and 3 of 260 patients (1.2%) after subsequently receiving at least one 150 Unit dose. Response to subsequent BOTOX treatment was not different following seroconversion in these three patients. In detrusor overactivity associated with neurologic condition patients with analyzable specimens in the adult drug development program (including the open-label extension study), neutralizing antibodies developed in 3 of 300 patients (1.0%) after receiving only BOTOX 200 Unit doses and 5 of 258 patients (1.9%) after receiving at least one 300 Unit dose. Following development of neutralizing antibodies in these 8 patients, 4 continued to experience clinical benefit, 2 did not experience clinical benefit, and the effect on the response to BOTOX in the remaining 2 patients is not known. In 99 pediatric patients who had a negative baseline result for binding antibodies or neutralizing antibodies and had at least one evaluable post-baseline value from one randomized double-blind study and one double-blind extension study, no patients developed neutralizing antibodies after receiving 50 Units to 200 Units of BOTOX. The data reflect the patients whose test results were considered positive for neutralizing activity to BOTOX in a mouse protection assay or negative based on a screening ELISA assay or mouse protection assay. Formation of neutralizing antibodies to botulinum toxin type A may reduce the effectiveness of BOTOX treatment by inactivating the biological activity of the toxin. The critical factors for neutralizing antibody formation have not been well characterized. The results from some studies suggest that BOTOX injections at more frequent intervals or at higher doses may lead to greater incidence of antibody formation. The potential for antibody formation may be minimized by injecting with the lowest effective dose given at the longest feasible intervals between injections. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BOTOX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: abdominal pain; alopecia, including madarosis; anorexia; brachial plexopathy; denervation/muscle atrophy; diarrhea; dry eye; eyelid edema (following periocular injection); hyperhidrosis; hypoacusis; hypoaesthesia; localized muscle twitching; malaise; Mephisto sign; paresthesia; peripheral neuropathy; radiculopathy; erythema multiforme, dermatitis psoriasiform, and psoriasiform eruption; strabismus; tinnitus; and visual disturbances. There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 , 5.6 )]. There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including cardiovascular disease. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established. New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established.",
    "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients receiving concomitant treatment of BOTOX and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents), or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of BOTOX may be potentiated ( 7.1 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Other Agents Interfering with Neuromuscular Transmission Co-administration of BOTOX and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of BOTOX may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects. 7.3 Other Botulinum Neurotoxin Products The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of BOTOX.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS BOTOX is contraindicated: In patients who are hypersensitive to any botulinum toxin product or to any of the components in the formulation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . In the presence of infection at the proposed injection site(s). For intradetrusor injection in patients with a urinary tract infection; or in patients with urinary retention or post-void residual (PVR) urine volume >200 mL who are not routinely performing clean intermittent self-catheterization (CIC) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 , 5.13 )] . Hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or to any of the components in the formulation ( 4 , 5.4 , 6 ) Infection at the proposed injection site ( 4 ) Intradetrusor Injections: Urinary tract infection or urinary retention ( 4 )",
    "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies or adequate data from postmarketing surveillance on the developmental risk associated with use of BOTOX in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of BOTOX during pregnancy resulted in adverse effects on fetal growth (decreased fetal weight and skeletal ossification) at clinically relevant doses, which were associated with maternal toxicity [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Data Animal Data When BOTOX (4, 8, or 16 Units/kg) was administered intramuscularly to pregnant mice or rats two times during the period of organogenesis (on gestation days 5 and 13), reductions in fetal body weight and decreased fetal skeletal ossification were observed at the two highest doses. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in these studies (4 Units/kg) is approximately equal to the human dose of 400 Units, on a body weight basis (Units/kg). When BOTOX was administered intramuscularly to pregnant rats (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, or 8 Units/kg) or rabbits (0.063, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 Units/kg) daily during the period of organogenesis (total of 12 doses in rats, 13 doses in rabbits), reduced fetal body weights and decreased fetal skeletal ossification were observed at the two highest doses in rats and at the highest dose in rabbits. These doses were also associated with significant maternal toxicity, including abortions, early deliveries, and maternal death. The developmental no-effect doses in these studies of 1 Unit/kg in rats and 0.25 Units/kg in rabbits are less than the human dose of 400 Units, based on Units/kg. When pregnant rats received single intramuscular injections (1, 4, or 16 Units/kg) at three different periods of development (prior to implantation, implantation, or organogenesis), no adverse effects on fetal development were observed. The developmental no-effect level for a single maternal dose in rats (16 Units/kg) is approximately 2 times the human dose of 400 Units, based on Units/kg.",
    "pediatric_use": "8.4 Pediatric Use Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition have been established in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of anticholinergic medication. Use of BOTOX in this patient population is based on the results of a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 113 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age (inclusive) with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition (Study 191622-120) and a long-term, multicenter, double-blind, long-term extension trial (Study 191622-121) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. The most common adverse reactions in this population were urinary tract infection, bacteriuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX have not been established in patients with NDO younger than 5 years of age. Overactive Bladder The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for the treatment of overactive bladder have not been established in pediatric patients. Efficacy was not demonstrated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose clinical study which was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BOTOX in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years with overactive bladder. Fifty-five patients who had an inadequate response to or were intolerant of at least one anticholinergic medication were treated with BOTOX. There was not a statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline in the daily average frequency of daytime urinary incontinence episodes (primary efficacy endpoint) at week 12 post-treatment when a medium and high dose were each compared to a low dose of BOTOX. The adverse reactions in pediatric patients treated with BOTOX were comparable with the known safety profile in adults with overactive bladder. Prophylaxis of Headaches in Chronic Migraine Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 123 adolescent patients (ages 12 to below 18 years) with chronic migraine were randomized to receive BOTOX 74 Units, BOTOX 155 Units, or placebo, for one injection cycle. This trial did not establish the efficacy of BOTOX, compared with placebo, for the prophylaxis of headaches in adolescents with chronic migraine. Spasticity Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX have been established by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of BOTOX in patients 2 to 17 years of age with upper and lower limb spasticity. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Axillary Hyperhidrosis Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Cervical Dystonia Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established. Blepharospasm and Strabismus Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established. Juvenile Animal Data In a study in which juvenile rats received intramuscular injection of BOTOX (0, 8, 16, or 24 Units/kg) every other week from postnatal day 21 for 12 weeks, changes in bone size/geometry associated with decreased bone density and bone mass were observed at all doses, in association with limb disuse, decreased muscle contraction, and decreased body weight gain. Impairment of fertility and male reproductive organ histopathology (degeneration of seminiferous tubules of the testis) were observed at the mid and high doses. Bone and male reproductive organ effects showed evidence of reversibility after dosing cessation. The no-effect dose for adverse developmental effects in juvenile animals (8 Units/kg) is similar to the human dose (400 Units) on a body weight (kg) basis.",
    "geriatric_use": "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2145 adult patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies of BOTOX for the treatment of spasticity, 33.5% were 65 or older, and 7.7% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between elderly patients and adult patients younger than 65 years of age. In clinical studies of BOTOX across other indications, no overall differences in safety were observed between elderly patients and younger adult patients, with the exception of Overactive Bladder (see below). Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Overactive Bladder Of 1242 overactive bladder patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies of BOTOX, 41.4% were 65 years of age or older, and 14.7% were 75 years of age or older. Adverse reactions of UTI and urinary retention were more common in patients 65 years of age or older in both placebo and BOTOX groups compared to younger patients (see Table 24 ). Otherwise, there were no overall differences in the safety profile following BOTOX treatment between patients aged 65 years and older compared to adult patients younger than 65 years of age in these studies.
